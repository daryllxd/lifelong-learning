## Zach Holman: The Depression Thing
[Reference](https://zachholman.com/posts/the-depression-thing)

- Depression's funny like that. Not even depression, really; generally, we're really good at analyzing other people, but can't hold the mirror up to inspect ourselves quite as easily.
- Therapy basically got me rubber duck debugging myself. Even when I'm not programming I'm fucking programming, I can't get away from it, ha. But it's true: the mere notion that I'd have to discuss my life with someone else later meant that I became far better at self-analysis than I ever had been.
-  I find it kind of darkly amusing in retrospect that, ahem, some people will snort, chug, or smoke anything put in front of them as long as it's between the hours of 11pm Friday - 5am Saturday, but when it comes to taking “actual” drugs they start getting cold feet. You're changing your brain chemistry either way, and depending on the drug, sometimes permanently. So yeah, it's worth having some concern about, of course, but presumably you're at the point where you're looking to make a permanent change anyway. I won't be as pithy as to trot out the oft-quoted David Foster Wallace passage on suicide and burning buildings, but he has a point. Sometimes it's easier to jump, even if the change is permanent.
- I get why some people are worried about meds “taking over” and losing your true self, but I also know that the reverse can be true: I don't think I was actually myself until starting about a year ago, a few months after I started therapy and drugs.
- But still, I obviously think it's worth talking about. People act so weirdly when it comes to this stuff, precisely because we don't talk about it, even today, in 2017. Fuck flying cars and laser guns, I want transparent discussion of mental problems in society.
- I think a huge part of it is whether they've experienced it themselves, or, barring that, if they've ever had a close friend or partner go through this. It's truly night and day between the two extremes, and you don't always have to seek your best friends out and lean on them for support. Support comes from a lot of people; if you drop the ball, you might be surprised at who helps you pick it back up.
- **Notice and write down the achievements you actually do achieve. Keep a journal, or at the very least, keep a running todo list where you can check off even the basic things, like “clean my desk”. At the end of the day, you help yourself by seeing what you actually did. Sometimes doing the small things helps you start on doing the big things. My depression always prevented me from starting things, and from seeing what I did. That sucked, and was a self-defeating cycle.**
- Talk more about this. There's so much science involved with depression, which is both wild, but also a bit of a relief. You are not a bad person… you're not even flawed. Your brain just doesn't have the correct levels of chemicals and shit. You can fix or adjust to that in a lot of different ways, both with meds and without. Your body doesn't produce enough insulin? Bummer! Go to the doctor and get that shit checked out! No one says, “lol what a fucking weak-ass human because they can't monitor their insulin levels”. Brain chemistry is the same way. We're getting better as a society here, but this is something we need to address better and more often.

### HN Comments

- I ended up going into some escapism mentality where if I'm not working I'm going to play video games/watch TV. It was a terrible rut until one morning I looked in the mirror and realized I'm letting life slip away. I'm not growing (well at least not in the productive way). Mind you most of those "explosive" problems were solved, but I wasn't. I freaked out, threw on some gym clothes, went to the gym, and ran. I don't even know what I was running toward. But I was running. I began lifting again, doing meal prep, back to studying, programming pet projects, reading, and it all came together.
- If you are a low serotonin type, you could get your md to prescribe serotonin tablets (I haven't), but in the meantime, dark chocolate could also do it. The crucial thing though is to keep the supply steady. I have to wean off the chocolate after a few days.
- I've just noticed that sleeping, proper diet, and exercise are things that just keep me in motion. I guess one way to cope is to just build momentum.
- At the very least, I can say that I feel satisfied about things that I've accomplished, even if I still don't feel great about myself. And that is at least enough to keep me getting out of bed every morning instead of moping around.
- Exercise is great. I just came back from a trip and where I was killing myself for 5 days straight. The feel-goods after the exertion ended lasted about 4-5 days. Had a sweet workout on day 3, but a bit of anxiety set in day 5 with the subsequent drink to squash it..

## The Programmer's Great Clinical Depression
[Reference](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2016/10/07/programmers-great-clinical-depression/)

- Sunlight: our body is better equipped to regulate the amount of melatonin getting into our bloodstream naturally. Also, it regulates serotonin.
- Go to bed: sometimes, just sleep instead of finishing the problem.
- Exercise!
- Omega-3Fatty acid. Fish oil?
- Talk to real, living, human people.
- Dr. Ilardi's book recommends setting an actual, literal, timer for what he calls rumination. If you can't come to a meaningful actionable conclusion about a negative thought after 10 minutes, it's time to shut that thought off.

## Mirtazapine
[Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirtazapine)

- Remeron, used for the treatment of depression.
- Generalized anxiety, social anxiety, OCD, panic disorder.
- Fastest onset is 2 weeks, and is the same with other antidepressants at 6 weeks.
- Side effects: Weight gain and sleepiness, but less likely to cause tremor than tricyclic depressants.

## Ask HN: How to stop feeling depressed about whether you will be successful?
[Reference](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16515923)

- YMMV but I'd encourage you to take a break from consuming "success porn" online. That's my broad term for:
  - Social media: because people curate everything and only post things that make their lives look amazing. Real life isn't a constant string of wins, success, and happiness. Don't let it distort your view and wonder why your life isn't the same.
  - Startup news: TechCrunch, Recode, Bus. Insider, and even here on HN. Post after post about YC, funding rounds, growth, and–of course–big exits. Its easy to find them but the truth is, they are outlier events. If a big startup exit is something you want–fine, by all means go for it–but don't let any article fool you into thinking its easy or guaranteed if you follow some formula. It's not. Startups are hard. There is no guarantee of success because some things are beyond your control.
  - Success celebrities: avoid videos, podcasts, ebooks, and online courses from celebrity entrepreneurs. These are people who have had moderate success with a blog/vlog/startup/book/whatever and now want to teach everyone else how to do it. Truth is, they just want to take your money and time. The only thing you might learn is how to be just like them (yuck).
- Decreasing the amount of time I spent on social media has increased the quality of my life by at least 10 times. Before I used to feel intimidated going to the gym, posting on my tech blog, simply because everyone else was just doing it better than myself or at least I believed so and cared. When I went on to actually do and enjoy things, I noticed how everything is so imperfect and how in essence I do not care about others. It may sound funny, but that brought back the smell of roses. Another important side-effect was an increase in amount of in-person interaction with the people I wanted to interact.

Being depressed is a state of mind. Being successful or not has not much to do with it (which is proven in many papers). Anxiety about failure is just a way that it manifests. Your brain always finds some ways to rationalize things that it observes. That's its job.
So if you feel a bit of rush because you really want to succeed, or if you think about things that may go wrong in order to take actions to minimize the risk - that's perfectly fine and embrace it. But if it really brings you down, then it's a depression problem, not a startup problem and that's what you want to solve.

I'm sure you've heard many many times how failures are necessary learning experience and all that stuff. But if your brain chemistry is not ok, your brain will rationalize it away - "but that's my only shot" and so on. Once again, you need to fix that chemistry. HN will offer you many suggestions some of them very reasonable, but it's likely that a professional will give you some better options.

# Laziness Does Not Exist
[Reference](https://humanparts.medium.com/laziness-does-not-exist-3af27e312d01)

- And when you don't fully understand a person's context — what it feels like to be them every day, all the small annoyances and major traumas that define their life — it's easy to impose abstract, rigid expectations on a person's behavior. **All homeless people should put down the bottle and get to work. Never mind that most of them have mental health symptoms and physical ailments, and are fighting constantly to be recognized as human. Never mind that they are unable to get a good night's rest or a nourishing meal for weeks or months on end. Never mind that even in my comfortable, easy life, I can't go a few days without craving a drink or making an irresponsible purchase. They have to do better.**
- For decades, psychological research has been able to explain procrastination as a functioning problem, not a consequence of laziness.
  - **When a person fails to begin a project that they care about, it's typically due to either a) anxiety about their attempts not being “good enough” or b) confusion about what the first steps of the task are. Not laziness. In fact, procrastination is more likely when the task is meaningful and the individual cares about doing it well.**
- Over the years, at that same school, I encountered countless other students who were under-estimated because the barriers in their lives were not seen as legitimate. There was the young man with OCD who always came to class late, because his compulsions sometimes left him stuck in place for a few moments. There was the survivor of an abusive relationship, who was processing her trauma in therapy appointments right before my class each week.

# Unpacking the “Day Job”
[Reference](https://humanparts.medium.com/unpacking-the-day-job-7095c1f27c11)

- Thank god by that point I understood that pivoting to some writing-related job, capitalizing on the one thing that really did bring me pleasure, would not be the golden ticket to “loving my work.” If I sit with a piece of writing and search the thesaurus long enough, I can kind of make it work. But it's not intuitive to me the way spreadsheets and slide decks are — the tools I professionally grew up on. I keep at it because I want to untangle and ideally convey my own specific thoughts, and I'll work tirelessly to get there. But if I had to do this on the clock, to convey someone else's thoughts? There's no way. I would work way harder, get paid way less, and end up hating writing.
- And so I swallowed the hard, cold fact — intuitive to many but which took me a long time to confront — that our society isn't at all structured for most people to actually do what they love for money, so much as it is for companies to exploit this ethos. From there, I stopped chasing the elusive millennial dream and found a well-paying job but one where I was no longer managing a team or on a particular leadership track. And my work shifted from something that defined me, to something I did for money.
- This is an uncomfortable shift when you've long equated your self-worth with your professional accomplishments. By now, I've mostly shed any desire to climb a professional ladder; I do my job and collect my paycheck. And yet my whole professional setting is designed around the assumption that everyone working there does and should want more.
  - **On the rare occasion I log into LinkedIn, I see my peers and former colleagues boasting of new titles and I have to close it quickly as if I were Dracula and someone had switched on a light. It conjures my old self and her framework for success, which makes me feel ashamed that I've given up after all the work that she put in.**
  - I have to remind myself that I'm not a quitter, per se, I've just decided to play a different game, a game that's more interesting and challenging to me at this point in my life.
- More and more women my age (older millennials) are waking up to the idea that our jobs are not everything, that they can just be, well, jobs. And that most jobs are wrought with capitalist compromise, no matter the “impact” they allege. This is not to say we don't take our work seriously and do it well, but our self-worth is no longer wrapped up in our title or salary.
  - Part of it is the simple reality of getting older. We want to prove we can do something, then we do it, and realize it's not all it's cracked up to be, so we move on. Part of it is the time we grew up in.
- Because I work in tech, which is a grossly overpaid industry, for the past seven years or so since I started writing, I have taken 4–6 months off every few years between jobs to write.
  - This is a huge privilege, obviously (and maintaining the ability to do this is one of many reasons why I don't think I'll have kids and also why I work in tech).
  - But as someone with a deeply rooted scarcity mindset who does not come from money, I was absolutely terrified at first to leave my job and dip into savings — for what, my own self discovery? It felt completely ridiculous. It also felt unbearably urgent.
  - If you have the means and an itch, I cannot recommend it enough — each time was worth every penny. These stretches allowed me to explore writing in earnest and eventually complete a draft of my novel. It's unfortunate that this isn't encouraged more, but is instead scrutinized. Each time I take extended periods away from traditional work, suspicion of my resume grows and it becomes harder to get the next job.

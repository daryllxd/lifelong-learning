# Management 101

- The secret or managing is keeping the people who hate you away from the ones who haven't made up their minds.
- Managers who care about you as a person, and who actively work to help you grow in your career. Managers who teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback.
- 1-on-1: they create human connection between you and your manager. *Being an introvert is not an excuse for making no effort to treat people like real human beings, however.* The bedrock of strong teams is human connection, which leads to trust. And trust, real trust, requires the ability and willingness to be vulnerable in front of each other. So, the manager will hopefully treat you like a human who has a life outside of work, and spend a few minutes talking about that life when you meet.
- Good 1-1s are not status meetings. Share the responsibility of having good 1-1s with your manager. Come with an agenda of things you would like to discuss.
- Feedback: Your manager needs to be your number one ally.
- Role of manager as the person who provides mentoring and training is not a universal expectation. In some companies, there is a training arm. *Your manager should have an idea of whether you are qualified to be promoted. If you're interested in being promoted, it's important to ask your manager for specific areas to focus on in order to get that promotion.*
- Your manager can point out opportunities for growth. *What your want to do, what you want to learn, and what will make you happy rests on your shoulders.* Bring agendas to your 1-1s when you have things you need to talk about. When you want to work on projects, ask. Advocate for yourself. When your manager isn't helpful, look for other places to get help. When you're unhappy, say something. When you're stuck, ask for help.
- Your manager cannot force work-life balance on you. If you wanna go home, figure out how to get your work done and go home.

# Mentoring

- *People are not good at saying precisely what they mean in a way that others can exactly understand.* When you're face to face with another person, interpret his body language and the way he's saying those words.
- Mentee - might not ask "stupid questions". Nervous about screwing the opportunity up.
- Mentor:
  - Be curious and open-minded. Working with new people who are learning things for the first time can shed light on these hidden patterns and help you make connections you may not otherwise have made.
  - Listen and speak their language. Software development is a team sport.

# Tech Lead

- Good communicator - can write documents, presentations, and could talk to people in different things and different roles and explain what was going on.
- Tech lead - continue to write code, but represent the group to management, vet the plans for feature delivery, and deal with details of the product management process.
- Standards:
  - Regular 1-1 touch bases.
  - Regular feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, areas for improvement, and praise as warranted.
- A leader spends at least 30% of the time writing code with the team.
- *You need to be willing to step away from the code and figure out how to balance your technical commitments with the work your whole team needs.*
- Roles:
  - Systems architect and business analyst. How to design complex software. Also, how to understand biz requirements and translate them into software.
  - Project planner: what are the deliverables.
  - Team leader.
- Managing a project:
  - Start breaking down via spreadsheet.
  - Push through the details and the unknowns.
  - Run and adjust the plan as you go.
  - Use insights in planning to manage requirements changes.
- Tech lead: Communicate. You represent the team, communicate their needs, and bring information from that meeting back to the team.

# Managing People

- "New manager" is an entry-level job with no seniority, and that's the best mindset with which to start leading.
- Build trust and rapport
  - How do you like to be praised, in public or in private?
  - What is your preferred method of communication for serious feedback? Writing, or verbal?
  - Why did you decide to work here? What are you excited about?
  - How do I know when you're in a bad mood or annoyed? Are there things that always put you in a bad mood?
  - Are they any manager behaviours that you know you hate?
  - Do you have any clear career goals that I should know about so I can help you achieve them?
  - Any surprises that I should know about?
- 30-60-90 plan for new reports - you want them to have clear goals that will show whether they're learning the right things.
- Encourage participation by updating the new hire documentation.
- Communicate your style and expectations.
- Get feedback from your new hire.
- 1-1 Styles
  - To-do list meeting: Both have list of topics for discussion, add to the list when a thought comes up.
  - Catch-up: Listen if anything my direct reports want to discuss.
  - Feedback: When someone does something that needs immediate corrective feedback, do it immediately if possible.
  - Take notes - shared document.
- Delegation is not the same as abdication.
- Treat the open sharing of information in a neutral to positive way.
- Culture of continuous feedback - sharing both positive and corrective feedback. Managers and peers are encouraged to note when things are going well and raise issues as they happen.
- Concrete examples and excerpts from peer reviews.
- Areas for improvement: keep it focused. Avoid big surprises. Schedule enough time to discuss the review.
- Identifying potential: Working hard to go the extra mile, offering insightful suggestions on problems, helping the team in areas that were neglected.
- Firing Under-performers:
  -  Performance improvement plan: tell her she is not meeting expectations - this is why you have to give feedback early and often, and keep records of the feedback that you're giving.

# Managing a Team

- Engineering lead - large impact on the success of the organisation. Identify the most high-value projects and keep the team focused on these projects. Should be comfortable managing team members with different skill sets from their own. They communicate expectations, solicit/deliver individual feedback frequently. Communicate timeline, scope, risks, etc. Identify area of tech debt.
- "My job is to help them succeed however I could."
- Need technical credibility. If you don't stay in the code, you make yourself technically obsolete too early in your career.
- Strong engineering managers can identify the shortest path through the systems to implement new features. Try to stay technical until you feel that you have truly mastered what you want to learn for writing code and designing systems, and then decide if you want to switch careers into management.
- Dysfunction
  - Not shipping: Balance pushing and holding the team back. Also, having infrequent releases might be because they have poor tooling, manual testing,
  - Removing drama people: on fixing negative people: make it clear that the behaviour has to change, bring clear examples, and provide corrective feedback quickly after things happen.
  - Overwork: slow down things for a while.
  - Collaboration: Have productive conversations about possible improvements. Don't undermine in front of the team. Even when you are frustrated with them, try to stay positive and supportive of their efforts in public.
  - Creating opportunities for them to hang out without it being all about work. Taking the whole team to lunch, etc.
  - Shield vs parent: You are not their parent. Your team is made up of adults who need to be treated with appropriate respect. This respect is important for your sanity as well as for theirs.
  - Good decision-making: create a data-driven team culture. Data about team productivity (the time it takes to complete features), data about quality measures (how much time is spent dealing with outages, or bugs found in QA or after releases).
  - Knowing the product roadmap helps your guide the technical roadmap.
  - Review the outcome of your decisions and projects.
- Managing Conflict
  - Don't rely exclusively on consensus or voting.
  - Do set up clear processes to depersonalise decisions. When you assign the ownership for making a decision to someone on the team, make it clear which members of the team should be consulted for feedback, and who needs to be informed of the decision or plan.
  - Don't take it out on another team.
  - Do remember to be kind. It's natural and perfectly human to want to be liked by other people. Many of us believe the way to be liked is to be seen as nice, but your goal as manager is to not be nice, it is to be kind. Nice is being polite, kind is about doing the right thing. If someone's behaviour is disruptive, then you should say it.
  - Do get curious. "Am I afraid that if I make an unpopular but necessary decision that people will be mad at me? Am I avoiding working through this issue with my peer because she's difficult to work with, or am I just hoping the issue will just resolve itself?
- Happy engineering team: If you buy them pizza in the evening, will they stick around and socialise together, or will they race out the door as quickly as possible? Of course, people have obligations and passions outside of work, but cohesive teams don't view their team as something they're eager to escape every day.
- ***A team should have its members be willing to take risks and make mistakes in front of one another. This is the underpinning of a successful team. The work of gelling a team begins by creating the friendliness that leads to psychological safety.***
- When companies talk abut hiring for "culture fit", they often mean they want to hire people they can be friendly with.

## Project management

- 20% of the time for generic, sustaining engineering work across the board. Testing, debugging, cleaning up legacy code, migrating language or platform versions, doing other work that needs to happen.
- As you approach deadlines, it's your job to say no.
- Use the doubling rule, but push for planning time to estimate longer tasks.
- Be selective about what you estimate.
- Joining a small team:
  - Get someone to walk you through the system and architecture.
  - Read the developer onboarding process.
  - Watch the code base, code reviews, PRs if they exist.
  - Plan to work out on a couple of features in your first 60 days.
  - This means, you're slower to onboard technically, but more technically capable and credible.

# Managing Multiple Teams

# Managing Managers

# The Big Leagues

# Bootstrapping Culture

- Structure => learning. Process => transparency. Healthy teams - you need to have a sense of what's important to you, to your company, and to your colleagues.
- Pretending to lack structure tends to create hidden power structures resulting from the nature of human communication and the challenges of trying to scale that communication.
- Structure - how we scale, diversify, and take on more complex long-term tasks. We do it to our software, our teams, and in our processes. ***In the same way that strong technical systems designers are capable of identifying and shaping underlying system structures, strong leaders are capable of identifying and shaping underlying team structures and dynamics, and doing so in a way that supports the long-term goals of the team and equips the individuals to achieve their best.***
- A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system. *Your company started as a very simple system that contained a few people, and as more and more people and rules and infrastructure were added, it evolved into a complex system. I don’t think there’s a huge benefit in over-designing your team structure or process when your team is small and functioning well.*
- When every new hire slows the team down for months because there is no onboarding process, that is a failure due to lack of structure. When people regularly leave the company because they have no path to advancement or career growth, that is a failure due to lack of structure. The third time you have a production outage because someone logged directly into the database and accidentally dropped a critical table, that is a failure due to lack of structure. I said earlier that I prefer to talk about learning and transparency rather than using the word structure, because really what we’re talking about here is identifying the causes of failures, especially frequent failures, and trying to figure out what we can change to solve for those failures. This is fundamentally about learning.

## Creating your Culture

- Culture is the generally unspoken shared rules of a community. American culture dictates that we shake hands as a greeting, for example, while in some other cultures, touching strangers is considered very odd. The way you address people of different standings or different relationships to you is part of your culture. Culture doesn't mean that every single person holds exactly the same values, but it tends to guide a general overlap, and it creates a bunch of rules of interaction that you don’t have to think much about if you are deeply ingrained in that culture.
- But in complex environments where the needs of the group must override the needs of the individual, cultural values are the glue that enables us to work as a team and make decisions when faced with uncertainty. This is why figuring out and guiding your culture is such an important part of building a successful company.
- Not every person will fit in at every company. The sooner you realize this, the better. Sometimes we are afraid to have core values because we believe they will create discrimination. I would argue that a thoughtfully created set of values that are actually values should reduce the kinds of surface discrimination that often happen at tech companies in favor of creating a real community of employees who share core principles and ways of communication.
- If you come into a company with core values, those values were probably created by the founders, or founders and early employees, and thus they reflect the company’s culture. This is important to understand, because you’ll be measured against these values whether you realize it or not. The founding team’s values will be reinforced, recognized, and rewarded inside of the company. My experience has shown that employees who truly embrace and exhibit all of the core values of a company tend to do well naturally. The fit is easy for them. They may get stressed out or work too hard, but they are well liked and usually happy. Those who do not match all of these values as easily will have a harder time. That doesn't mean they will fail, but there will be more friction for them, and it may feel like more work to fit in and feel accepted.
- Culture fit: "Would you like being stuck in an airport with this person?" You don't want to hire people that your team can't stand around to be around, but cultural fit is not about hiring friends.

## Cross-functional teams

- Cross-functional product development groups are popular for a good reason. By putting everyone needed to make a project successful together in one group, you help the members of those teams focus on the project at hand, and you make the communication for the whole group much more effective.
- Engineers assigned to product pods still need some time to account for engineering-specific tasks like on-call, interviewing, and sustaining engineering/technical debt.
- Code review
  - Tests catch bugs, code reviews don't catch bugs.
  - Linter for style issues.
  - Review backlog.

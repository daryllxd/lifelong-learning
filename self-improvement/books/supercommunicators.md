# Prologue

Who would you call if you were having a bad day? If you had screwed up a deal at work, or had gotten into an argument with your spouse, or were feeling frustrated and sick of it all: Who would you want to talk to? There’s likely someone that you know who will make you feel better, who can help you think through a thorny question or share a moment of heartbreak or joy.

“You’re not listening to me,” they interrupted.

“We don’t need clearer roles.  
We need to do a better job of respecting each other.”

They wanted to talk about how people were treating one another, but I was obsessed with practical fixes. They had told me they needed empathy, but rather than listen, I replied with solutions.

- Many discussions are actually three different conversations:
    - **Practical, decision-making conversations that focus on "What’s This Really About?"**
    - **Emotional conversations, which ask "How Do We Feel?"**
    - **Social conversations that explore "Who Are We?"**
- We often move in and out of all three conversations as a dialogue unfolds.
- If we aren’t having the same kind of conversation as our partners at the same moment, we’re unlikely to connect with each other.

Our goal, for the

most meaningful discussions, should be to have a “learning conversation.

”

Specifically, we want to learn how the people around us see the world and help

them understand our perspectives in turn.


# THE MATCHING PRINCIPLE

The most surprising aspect of the Farm’s curriculum was the CIA’s deep commitment to the art of conversation. Lawler discovered that working for the CIA was fundamentally about communication, not just covert operations. Field officers were expected to build relationships—talking to people at parties, making friends in embassies, and bonding with foreign officials—with the hope of eventually having important, confidential conversations. Communication was so central that CIA training materials emphasize: “Find ways to connect.” The goal for a case officer is to become someone a prospective agent feels truly understood by, sometimes believing the officer is the only person who really gets them.

This raises the question: how do we create genuine connections with others? Whether convincing someone to take a risk or simply bonding with a new friend or boss, the challenge is to encourage openness and show attentive listening. Researchers like Wheatley highlight that the mystery of why people “click” remains unsolved, but when we align through conversation, it feels deeply rewarding. Our brains are wired to crave these connections, which have helped our species survive by fostering communities and alliances.

To truly communicate, we must connect—absorbing each other’s words so our brains, and even our physical responses, synchronize. Scientists have identified “high centrality participants” in groups—people who facilitate synchrony by asking more questions, reflecting others’ moods, and making it easier for everyone to speak up. These individuals don’t dominate conversations; instead, they adapt their communication style to match the group, encourage others, and gently lead discussions. As a result, they often have larger social networks and are trusted with leadership or advice.

Supercommunicators evoke this synchronization by encouraging others to match communication styles. Studies of happy couples show that mirroring each other’s speaking styles—asking questions, repeating what’s said, sharing jokes, or matching seriousness—builds closeness. The next time you sense conflict, try asking: “Do you want to talk about our emotions? Do we need to make a decision? Or is this about something else?” This approach, rooted in the CIA’s training and echoed by communication science, is key to building trust and genuine connection.

In other words, CIA recruiters are taught how to synchronize. “Once you understand how it works, it’s completely learnable,” an officer trained by Lawler explained. She described herself as an introvert who hadn’t thought much about communication before her training, but once she learned how conversations function and how to pay attention to what’s happening, she began noticing things she had previously missed. These skills aren’t just for work; she uses them with her parents, her boyfriend, and even people at the grocery store. She also observes her colleagues applying their training in everyday meetings, nudging each other to align better, listen more closely, and speak in ways that make it easier for others to understand. “From the outside, it seems like a Jedi mind trick, but it’s just something you learn, and then practice, and then do,” she said.

# The Four Rules for a Meaningful Conversation

The most effective communicators pause before they speak and ask themselves: Why am I opening my mouth?

This can be as simple as taking a moment to clarify, for yourself, what you hope to say and how you want to say it. For example: “My goal is to ask Maria if she wants to vacation together, but in a way that makes it easy for her to say no.” Or it might involve asking a spouse, as he describes a hard day, “Do you want me to suggest some solutions, or do you just need to vent?”

In one exercise, before each gathering, every attendee scribbled out a goal: “This is to choose a budget that everyone agrees on,” or “This is to air our complaints and hear each other out.” The exercise never took more than a few minutes. Some people shared what they wrote at the meeting’s start; others did not.

First, the sentences people wrote usually indicated what kind of conversation they were seeking, as well as the mood they hoped to establish. They typically specified an aim (“air our complaints”) and a mindset (“hear each other out”). Second, when everyone scribbled their goals ahead of time, verbal arguments declined significantly. People still disagreed, were competitive, and got upset, but they were more likely to walk away satisfied, feeling heard and understanding others better. Because they had determined what kind of conversation they wanted, they could convey their intents more clearly and listen as others declared their own goals.

Of course, before we phone a friend or chat with a spouse, we don’t need to write out a sentence about our goals every time. But if it’s an important conversation, taking a moment to formulate what we hope to say and how we hope to say it is a good idea. Then, during the discussion, try to observe your companions: Are they emotional? Do they seem practical-minded? Do they keep bringing up other people or social topics?

## EVERY CONVERSATION IS A NEGOTIATION

The best negotiators didn’t battle over who should get the biggest slice of pie. Rather, they focused on making the pie itself larger, finding win-win solutions where everyone walked away happier than before. The concept that both sides could “win” in a negotiation, Fisher and his colleagues wrote, might seem impossible, but “it is increasingly recognized that there are cooperative ways of negotiating our differences and that even if a ‘win-win’ solution cannot be found, a wise agreement can still often be reached that is better for both sides.”

Since _Getting to Yes_ was first published, hundreds of studies have found ample evidence to support this idea. Elite diplomats have explained that their goal at a bargaining table isn’t seizing victory, but rather convincing the other side to become collaborators in uncovering new solutions that no one thought of before. Negotiation, among its top practitioners, isn’t a battle. It’s an act of creativity.

Among the surest methods for sparking this kind of experimentation is introducing new themes and questions to a discussion, adding items to the table until the conversation has changed enough that new possibilities are revealed. “If you’re negotiating over salaries, for instance, and you’re stuck,” Gelfand said, “then drag something new in: ‘We’ve been focused on wages, but what if, instead of increasing paychecks, we give everyone more sick days? What if we let them work from home?’”

What’s This Really About? discussions tend to fall into one of two buckets. There are some conversations where people signal they are in a practical mindset: They want to solve a problem or think through an idea. They want to decide how much to bid for that house—and what does that mean about our life together?—or who to hire for the job they’ve been advertising—and do we actually need another employee? These discussions call for analysis and clearheaded reasoning. Psychologists refer to this kind of thinking as the logic of costs and benefits. When people embrace logical reasoning and practical calculations—when they agree that rational decision making is the most persuasive method for making a choice together—they’re agreeing to contrast potential costs with hoped-for benefits.

But in some other What’s This Really About? conversations, the aim is different. Sometimes people want to make choices together that might not align with logic and reason. They want to explore topics beyond cold rationality. They want to apply their compassion, talk about values, discuss matters of right and wrong in making joint decisions. They want to draw on their experiences, even if they don’t completely overlap with the situation at hand.

The first step of a quiet negotiation is figuring out what people want from a conversation. The second step is determining how we’re going to make choices together—and that means deciding if this is a rational conversation or an empathetic one. Are we going to make decisions through analysis and reason, or through empathy and narratives?

It’s easy to get this wrong. In fact, I have gotten it wrong many times. When one of my cousins started telling me about wild conspiracy theories (“Mattress stores are money-laundering fronts!”), I tried to convince him he was mistaken by using data and facts (“Actually, most of them are publicly traded, so you can see their finances online”). Then I was surprised when he said that I had been brainwashed. He was using a logic that drew on stories he had heard about elites taking advantage of other people, a logic of similarities that said we ought to be suspicious about corporations because they have lied before. My reasonable arguments, my logic of costs and benefits, wasn’t persuasive to him in the slightest.

Or say you’ve telephoned a customer service representative with a complaint. You might assume they want to hear your story (“My son was playing with my phone and he somehow managed to order a thousand dollars’ worth of Legos”), but you quickly discover they don’t care (“Sir, please just give me the date of the transaction”). They don’t need the backstory. They’re in a practical mindset, and just want to find a solution and move on to the next call.

How do we connect during a What’s This Really About? conversation? The first step is trying to figure out what each of us wants from a discussion, what we are seeking from this dialogue. That’s how we get at the deeper questions beneath the surface.

Boly connected with his fellow jurors by understanding that each person wanted something different. Some wanted to talk about justice; others wanted to focus on law and order. Some wanted facts; others craved empathy.

When someone says, “Can we talk about the upcoming meeting?” or “That memo was crazy, right?” or worries aloud, “I’m not sure he can get the job done,” they are inviting us into a What’s This Really About? discussion, signaling there’s something deeper they want to discuss. Boly knew how to listen for those signals, and Dr. Ehdaie learned how to look for them.

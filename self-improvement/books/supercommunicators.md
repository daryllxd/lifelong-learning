# Prologue

Who would you call if you were having a bad day? If you had screwed up a deal at work, or had gotten into an argument with your spouse, or were feeling frustrated and sick of it all: Who would you want to talk to? There’s likely someone that you know who will make you feel better, who can help you think through a thorny question or share a moment of heartbreak or joy.

“You’re not listening to me,” they interrupted.

“We don’t need clearer roles.  
We need to do a better job of respecting each other.”

They wanted to talk about how people were treating one another, but I was obsessed with practical fixes. They had told me they needed empathy, but rather than listen, I replied with solutions.

- Many discussions are actually three different conversations:
    - **Practical, decision-making conversations that focus on "What’s This Really About?"**
    - **Emotional conversations, which ask "How Do We Feel?"**
    - **Social conversations that explore "Who Are We?"**
- We often move in and out of all three conversations as a dialogue unfolds.
- If we aren’t having the same kind of conversation as our partners at the same moment, we’re unlikely to connect with each other.

Our goal, for the

most meaningful discussions, should be to have a “learning conversation.

”

Specifically, we want to learn how the people around us see the world and help

them understand our perspectives in turn.


# THE MATCHING PRINCIPLE

The most surprising aspect of the Farm’s curriculum was the CIA’s deep commitment to the art of conversation. Lawler discovered that working for the CIA was fundamentally about communication, not just covert operations. Field officers were expected to build relationships—talking to people at parties, making friends in embassies, and bonding with foreign officials—with the hope of eventually having important, confidential conversations. Communication was so central that CIA training materials emphasize: “Find ways to connect.” The goal for a case officer is to become someone a prospective agent feels truly understood by, sometimes believing the officer is the only person who really gets them.

This raises the question: how do we create genuine connections with others? Whether convincing someone to take a risk or simply bonding with a new friend or boss, the challenge is to encourage openness and show attentive listening. Researchers like Wheatley highlight that the mystery of why people “click” remains unsolved, but when we align through conversation, it feels deeply rewarding. Our brains are wired to crave these connections, which have helped our species survive by fostering communities and alliances.

To truly communicate, we must connect—absorbing each other’s words so our brains, and even our physical responses, synchronize. Scientists have identified “high centrality participants” in groups—people who facilitate synchrony by asking more questions, reflecting others’ moods, and making it easier for everyone to speak up. These individuals don’t dominate conversations; instead, they adapt their communication style to match the group, encourage others, and gently lead discussions. As a result, they often have larger social networks and are trusted with leadership or advice.

Supercommunicators evoke this synchronization by encouraging others to match communication styles. Studies of happy couples show that mirroring each other’s speaking styles—asking questions, repeating what’s said, sharing jokes, or matching seriousness—builds closeness. The next time you sense conflict, try asking: “Do you want to talk about our emotions? Do we need to make a decision? Or is this about something else?” This approach, rooted in the CIA’s training and echoed by communication science, is key to building trust and genuine connection.

In other words, CIA recruiters are taught how to synchronize. “Once you understand how it works, it’s completely learnable,” an officer trained by Lawler explained. She described herself as an introvert who hadn’t thought much about communication before her training, but once she learned how conversations function and how to pay attention to what’s happening, she began noticing things she had previously missed. These skills aren’t just for work; she uses them with her parents, her boyfriend, and even people at the grocery store. She also observes her colleagues applying their training in everyday meetings, nudging each other to align better, listen more closely, and speak in ways that make it easier for others to understand. “From the outside, it seems like a Jedi mind trick, but it’s just something you learn, and then practice, and then do,” she said.

# The Four Rules for a Meaningful Conversation

![[CleanShot 2025-06-24 at 09.33.08@2x.png]]

The most effective communicators pause before they speak and ask themselves: Why am I opening my mouth?

This can be as simple as taking a moment to clarify, for yourself, what you hope to say and how you want to say it. For example: “My goal is to ask Maria if she wants to vacation together, but in a way that makes it easy for her to say no.” Or it might involve asking a spouse, as he describes a hard day, “Do you want me to suggest some solutions, or do you just need to vent?”

In one exercise, before each gathering, every attendee scribbled out a goal: “This is to choose a budget that everyone agrees on,” or “This is to air our complaints and hear each other out.” The exercise never took more than a few minutes. Some people shared what they wrote at the meeting’s start; others did not.

First, the sentences people wrote usually indicated what kind of conversation they were seeking, as well as the mood they hoped to establish. They typically specified an aim (“air our complaints”) and a mindset (“hear each other out”). Second, when everyone scribbled their goals ahead of time, verbal arguments declined significantly. People still disagreed, were competitive, and got upset, but they were more likely to walk away satisfied, feeling heard and understanding others better. Because they had determined what kind of conversation they wanted, they could convey their intents more clearly and listen as others declared their own goals.

Of course, before we phone a friend or chat with a spouse, we don’t need to write out a sentence about our goals every time. But if it’s an important conversation, taking a moment to formulate what we hope to say and how we hope to say it is a good idea. Then, during the discussion, try to observe your companions: Are they emotional? Do they seem practical-minded? Do they keep bringing up other people or social topics?

## EVERY CONVERSATION IS A NEGOTIATION

The best negotiators didn’t battle over who should get the biggest slice of pie. Rather, they focused on making the pie itself larger, finding win-win solutions where everyone walked away happier than before. The concept that both sides could “win” in a negotiation, Fisher and his colleagues wrote, might seem impossible, but “it is increasingly recognized that there are cooperative ways of negotiating our differences and that even if a ‘win-win’ solution cannot be found, a wise agreement can still often be reached that is better for both sides.”

Since _Getting to Yes_ was first published, hundreds of studies have found ample evidence to support this idea. Elite diplomats have explained that their goal at a bargaining table isn’t seizing victory, but rather convincing the other side to become collaborators in uncovering new solutions that no one thought of before. Negotiation, among its top practitioners, isn’t a battle. It’s an act of creativity.

Among the surest methods for sparking this kind of experimentation is introducing new themes and questions to a discussion, adding items to the table until the conversation has changed enough that new possibilities are revealed. “If you’re negotiating over salaries, for instance, and you’re stuck,” Gelfand said, “then drag something new in: ‘We’ve been focused on wages, but what if, instead of increasing paychecks, we give everyone more sick days? What if we let them work from home?’”

What’s This Really About? discussions tend to fall into one of two buckets. There are some conversations where people signal they are in a practical mindset: They want to solve a problem or think through an idea. They want to decide how much to bid for that house—and what does that mean about our life together?—or who to hire for the job they’ve been advertising—and do we actually need another employee? These discussions call for analysis and clearheaded reasoning. Psychologists refer to this kind of thinking as the logic of costs and benefits. When people embrace logical reasoning and practical calculations—when they agree that rational decision making is the most persuasive method for making a choice together—they’re agreeing to contrast potential costs with hoped-for benefits.

But in some other What’s This Really About? conversations, the aim is different. Sometimes people want to make choices together that might not align with logic and reason. They want to explore topics beyond cold rationality. They want to apply their compassion, talk about values, discuss matters of right and wrong in making joint decisions. They want to draw on their experiences, even if they don’t completely overlap with the situation at hand.

The first step of a quiet negotiation is figuring out what people want from a conversation. The second step is determining how we’re going to make choices together—and that means deciding if this is a rational conversation or an empathetic one. Are we going to make decisions through analysis and reason, or through empathy and narratives?

![[CleanShot 2025-06-24 at 09.40.26@2x.png]]
It’s easy to get this wrong. In fact, I have gotten it wrong many times. When one of my cousins started telling me about wild conspiracy theories (“Mattress stores are money-laundering fronts!”), I tried to convince him he was mistaken by using data and facts (“Actually, most of them are publicly traded, so you can see their finances online”). Then I was surprised when he said that I had been brainwashed. He was using a logic that drew on stories he had heard about elites taking advantage of other people, a logic of similarities that said we ought to be suspicious about corporations because they have lied before. My reasonable arguments, my logic of costs and benefits, wasn’t persuasive to him in the slightest.

Or say you’ve telephoned a customer service representative with a complaint. You might assume they want to hear your story (“My son was playing with my phone and he somehow managed to order a thousand dollars’ worth of Legos”), but you quickly discover they don’t care (“Sir, please just give me the date of the transaction”). They don’t need the backstory. They’re in a practical mindset, and just want to find a solution and move on to the next call.

How do we connect during a What’s This Really About? conversation? The first step is trying to figure out what each of us wants from a discussion, what we are seeking from this dialogue. That’s how we get at the deeper questions beneath the surface.

Boly connected with his fellow jurors by understanding that each person wanted something different. Some wanted to talk about justice; others wanted to focus on law and order. Some wanted facts; others craved empathy.

When someone says, “Can we talk about the upcoming meeting?” or “That memo was crazy, right?” or worries aloud, “I’m not sure he can get the job done,” they are inviting us into a What’s This Really About? discussion, signaling there’s something deeper they want to discuss. Boly knew how to listen for those signals, and Dr. Ehdaie learned how to look for them.

# Asking Questions and Noticing Clues

When someone says

something and then laughs afterward—even if it wasn’t funny—it’s a hint

they’re enjoying the conversation. When someone makes noises as they listen

(“Y eah,

” “Uh-huh,

” “Interesting”), it’s a sign they’re engaged, what linguists call

backchanneling. When someone asks follow-up questions (“What do you

mean?” “Why do you think he said that?”), it’s a clue they’re interested, whereas

statements that change the subject (“Let me ask you about this other thing”) are

hints they’re ready to move on.

## **Second Rule: Share your goals, and ask what others are seeking.**

Before a conversation starts:
![[CleanShot 2025-07-01 at 23.01.52@2x.png]]

- What are two topics you most want to discuss?
- What is one thing you hope to say that shows what you want to talk about?
- What is one question you will ask that reveals what others want?

## Open-ended questions
- Asking about someone’s beliefs or values (“How’d you decide to become a teacher?”)
- Asking someone to make a judgment (“Are you glad you went to law school?”)
- Asking about someone’s experiences (“What was it like to visit Europe?”)
## Clues
- Do your companions lean toward you, make eye contact, smile, backchannel ("Interesting," "Hmm"), or interrupt?
- Do they become quiet, their expressions passive, their eyes fixed somewhere besides your face? Do they seem overly contemplative? Do they take in your comments without adding thoughts of their own?
## Adding Items to the Table
- Has someone told a story or made a joke? If so, they might be in an empathetic logic of similarities mindset. In this mindset, people aren't looking to debate or analyze choices; they want to share, relate, and empathize.
- Or are they talking about plans and decisions, or evaluating options? Have they brought up politics or finances or choosing a place for next year's vacation? ("Is Maine or Florida better in June?") If so, they might be in a more practical logic of costs and benefits mindset, and you're better off getting analytical yourself.
- Listen for attempts to change the topic. People tell us what they want to discuss through their non sequiturs, asides, and sudden shifts—or, put differently, through the experiments they conduct. If someone asks the same question in different ways, or if they abruptly introduce a new subject, it's a sign they want to add something to the table and we'd be wise to let them proceed.
- Finally, experiment. Tell a joke. Ask an unexpected question. Introduce a new idea. Try interrupting, and then not interrupting. Watch to see if your companions play along. If they do, they're hinting at how they want to make decisions together, the rules and norms they accept. They are signaling how they'd like this conversation to unfold.

# THE LISTENING CURE

- Hearing people describe their emotional lives is important because when we talk about our feelings, we're describing not just what has happened to us, but why we made certain choices and how we make sense of the world. "When you describe how you feel, you're giving someone a map of the things you care about," Epley said. "That's why I connected with my parents, because I finally understood what mattered to them. I understood they were scared and worried and just wanted me to be safe."
- This is why the How Do We Feel? conversation is so crucial. Every discussion is shaped by our emotions, and when we bring those feelings to the surface-when we share them and ask others to share with us—we begin to see how we might align.
- In contrast, questions that pushed people to describe their beliefs, values, or meaningful experiences tended to result in emotional replies, even if the questions themselves didn't seem all that emotional. These kinds of questions were powerful because they often prompted people to reveal vulnerabilities. When someone asks "What do you value most in a friendship?" (question sixteen), it might not seem particularly emotionally probing, but it frequently draws unexpectedly revealing replies about past incidents of hurt or betrayal, or expressions of love for friends, or other anxieties or pleasures. Such questions make ever-deepening follow-ups ("What did you say after he broke up with you?") easy to ask.
- **Put another way, the difference between a shallow question and one that sparks an opportunity for emotional connection is vulnerability.** And vulnerability is what makes How Do We Feel? so powerful.
- This explains why the Fast Friends Procedure is so effective, and it illuminates which kinds of questions are most likely to help people emotionally align. There is a cycle: Asking deep questions about feelings, values, beliefs, and experiences creates vulnerability. That vulnerability triggers emotional contagion. And that, in turn, helps us connect.
![[CleanShot 2025-07-01 at 23.09.09@2x.png]]

- Questions about facts ("Where do you live?" "What college did you attend?") are often conversational dead-ends. They don't draw out values or experiences. They don't invite vulnerability.
- However, those same inquiries, recast slightly ("What do you like about where you live?" "What was your favorite part of college?"), invite others to share their preferences, beliefs, and values, and to describe experiences that caused them to grow or change. Those questions make emotional replies easier, and they practically beg the questioner to reciprocate to divulge, in return, why they live in this neighborhood, what they enjoyed about college-until everyone is drawn in, asking and answering back and forth.

| Shallow Questions                | Deep Questions                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Where do you live?               | What do you like about your neighborhood?      |
| Where do you work?               | What was your favorite job?                    |
| Where did you go to college?     | What was the best part of college?             |
| Are you married?                 | Tell me about your family.                     |
| How long have you lived here?    | What's the best place you've ever lived?       |
| Do you have any hobbies?         | If you could learn anything, what would it be? |
| Where did you go to high school? | What advice would you give a high schooler?    |
| Where are you from?              | What's the best thing about where you grew up? |

- There was one other key finding in the Harvard study of speed daters: Follow-up questions are particularly powerful. "Follow-ups are a signal that you're listening, that you want to know more," one of the researchers, Michael Yeomans, told me. Follow-up questions make reciprocity easier ("Your favorite part of college was ultimate frisbee? Me too! Do you still love to play?"). "They allow self-disclosure without it seeming like self-obsession," said Yeomans. "It makes a conversation flow."
- "It is easier to judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers," the nineteenth-century thinker Pierre-Marc-Gaston de Lévis wrote, and yet he stayed silent on which questions, exactly, should be asked. Science has provided guidance: Ask others about their beliefs and values. Ask them about experiences and those moments that caused them to change. Ask how they feel, rather than about facts. Reframe your questions so they are deeper. Ask follow-ups. And as people expose their vulnerabilities, reveal something about yourself. It will be less uncomfortable than you imagine. It will be more fascinating than you think. And it might lead to a moment of true connection.

# 4 - HOW DO YOU HEAR EMOTIONS NO ONE SAYS ALOUD?

- From infancy, even before we learn to speak, we absorb how to infer people's emotions from their behaviors: Their body language, vocal inflections, glances and grimaces, sighs and laughs. As we grow older, however, this capacity can atrophy. We start to pay increasing attention to what people say rather than what they do, to the point where we can fail to notice nonlinguistic clues. Spoken language is so information rich, so easy to rely upon, that it lulls us into ignoring hints that someone might be, say, upset -crossed arms, creased brow, downcast eyes—and instead focus on their words when they say, It's nothing. I feel fine.
## Big Bang Theory

- Sitcoms are so fast moving, joke after joke and twist after twist, that, to succeed, the audience needs to understand each character’s emotional state as soon as they appear on screen. What’s more, “the audience needs to see the emotional relationships between the characters,” Prady said.
- Emotions are everything in television. “They have to be obvious,” he told me. Put differently, it’s crucial for an audience to “hear” a character’s feelings, even when those emotions aren’t spoken aloud. That created a problem, however, because the characters in The Big Bang Theory were designed to be bad at expressing their feelings.
- One option was simply to have them announce their feelings-to tell, not show. There's a problem with this approach, though. "You can write dialogue like, 'I'm mad you're late for dinner!'" Prady told me. "But no one talks that way in real life." People don't announce their emotions. They perform them.
- The key to intuiting another's feelings is in the ability to read nonverbal channels: tone of voice, gesture, facial expressions and the like.
- "You cannot make a sitcom where the audience doesn't know how to feel," Prady told me. "It can't be twenty-two minutes of jokes with nothing emotionally holding it together."
## NASA

- NASA already had exceedingly high standards for potential astronauts: Applicants had to pass strenuous physicals; they needed a degree in science or engineering and experience in tasks like piloting fighter jets; they couldn't be too tall (anyone over six foot four wouldn't fit in a spacesuit) or too short (less than four foot eight and your feet wouldn't touch the floor and you might slip out of the shoulder belts); they had to show they could stay calm-one test sometimes used required them to keep their blood pressure steady during underwater maneuvers and could handle the stresses (and, optimally, avoid vomiting) on an airplane simulating zero-g.
- People with emotional intelligence knew how to build relationships and empathize with colleagues, as well as regulate their own emotionality and the emotions of those around them.
- **These individuals are aware of their own feelings and those of others. They are open to positive and negative aspects of internal experience, are able to label them, and when appropriate, communicate them.... The emotionally intelligent person is often a pleasure to be around and leaves others feeling better. The emotionally intelligent person, however, does not mindlessly seek pleasure, but rather attends to emotion in the path toward growth.**
- In 1976, a Soviet space mission had been canceled midway through after the crew began experiencing shared delusions and complaining of a strange scent that was later determined to be imaginary. Both the United States and the Soviet Union had diagnosed depression among astronauts and cosmonauts during, and after, missions in space, and had found that this despondency could lead to bickering, paranoia, and defensiveness with colleagues.
- But NASA's biggest worries focused on breakdowns in communication. The agency was still haunted by the events of 1968, when the crew of the Apollo 7 began arguing with mission control as they hurtled through the atmosphere. The disputes had specific causes at first: The three astronauts complained they were being rushed to complete tasks and given unclear commands. But the arguments gradually morphed into a formless anger and expressions of general discontent, until the astronauts were fighting about even minor issues: The quality of the food, NASA's orders to appear on an upcoming television broadcast, poor designs that made it difficult to use the bathroom, mission control's tone of voice. NASA psychologists later suggested that, due to the emotional stresses of the mission and his grief over the recent deaths of three other astronauts in a cockpit fire, Schirra had become combative and suspicious as the trip progressed. After they returned to earth, Schirra and his co-astronauts never flew into space again.

## LAUGHING AT WHAT'S NOT FUNNY

- "Contrary to our expectations," he reported in the journal American Scientist, "we found that **most conversational laughter is not a response to structured attempts at humor, such as jokes or stories**. Less than 20 percent of the laughter in our sample was a response to anything resembling a formal effort at humor."
- And so it follows that we exhibit emotional intelligence not just by hearing another person's feelings, but by showing we have heard them. Laughter, and other nonlinguistic expressions such as gasps and sighs, or smiles and frowns, are embodiments of the matching principle, which says that we communicate by aligning our behaviors until our brains become entrained.

![[CleanShot 2025-08-01 at 09.47.21@2x.png]]

- When we see someone and they exhibit an emotional behavior-like a laugh, a scowl, or a smile-the first thing we usually notice is their mood (is this person feeling positive or negative?) and their energy level (are they high energy or low energy?). For instance, if you encounter someone who is frowning (negative) and quiet (low energy), you might assume they're sad or frustrated, but you won't assume they pose a threat. Your brain won't start issuing warnings to flee.
- When people genuinely laughed together, their mood and energy almost always matched. If one person chuckled softly (positive, low energy), and their companion laughed in a similar way, they usually felt aligned. If another person exploded in laughter (positive, high energy), and their companion laughed back with the same basic volume, cadence, and forcefulness, they felt connected.
- The man was not selected as an astronaut. "It was clear to me he wasn't in the top tier for empathy," McGuire told me. Perhaps he was the type of person who didn't enjoy talking about his personal life. Maybe his father's death was still too raw to discuss easily. Neither of those were character flaws-but they indicated he was someone who was less practiced at emotional connection. That alone wasn't the sole reason for his rejection, "but it was part of it," McGuire said. NASA had plenty of qualified applicants and could afford to be picky. "We needed the best of the best, and that meant people who were exceptional at emotional intelligence."
- Big Bang: Instead, they would introduce a new character: Penny, a friendly aspiring actress who is waitressing while waiting to be discovered. "We went the other direction and made Penny light and bubbly," Prady told me. "Someone who, even though she's not book smart, is smart about people."
	- The question, though, was how to establish the relationship between Penny and the awkward physicists. The same conundrum still existed: The show needed to make clear to the audience what emotions the characters were feeling, while staying true to Sheldon's and Leonard's incompetence at emotional communication.
	- First scene of Big Bang re: "Hi" being said multiple times worked.
- The writers had finally cracked the code: The characters could be bumbling and graceless and socially incompetent—and as long as they obviously tried to match one another's mood and energy (or deliberately didn't match), it would be clear when they were connecting or at odds. The audience would understand what they were feeling and could root for them, celebrate when they bonded, feel good when everything worked out in the end (including when— spoiler alert!-Leonard and Penny got married a few seasons later).

# 5 - CONNECTING AMID CONFLICT

- It’s not breaking news to suggest we are living through a time of profound

polarization. Over the last decade, the number of Americans who say they are

“deeply angry” at the other political party has increased sharply, to almost 70

percent of the electorate.
- Conflict, of course, has always been part of life. We argue in our marriages

and friendships, at work and with our kids. Debate and dissent are part of

democracy, domesticity, and every meaningful relationship. As the human rights

activist Dorothy Thomas once wrote,

“Peace is not the absence of conflict, but

the ability to cope with it. ”
- So how do we achieve this kind of mutual understanding? The first step is

recognizing that within each fight is not just one conflict, but, at a minimum,

two: There’s the surface issue causing us to disagree with each other, and then

the emotional conflict underneath.

“Say you have a couple fighting with each

other about having another kid,

” Heen told me.

“There’s the top-level conflict—

you want another child, and I don’ t—that seems, at first glance, to explain why

they’re fighting. But there’s also a deeper emotional issue: I’m angry because

you’re prioritizing a kid over my career or I’m scared another child will

bankrupt us or I’m frustrated because you don’ t seem to care what I want.

”

Those emotional conflicts are sometimes nebulous, difficult to pin down, but

they’re also incredibly powerful—because they contain so much of the anger

and disappointment driving this argument beyond the possibility of compromise.
- The key, Heen found, entalled getting people to express their emotions, to have a version of the How Do We Feel? conversation that allowed both sides to express the hurt and suspicion fueling the fight. The problem, however, is that we often hate talking about our feelings during a disagreement. "People love to pretend that they can become analytical robots," Heen said. "But, of course, no one can do that. All that happens is your emotions leak out in other ways." Or people might recognize their own emotions, but they are loath to reveal them. They think it will give the other side an advantage or will be viewed as a weakness. They worry about revealing a vulnerability that will be weaponized by their foes. Not to mention, when we're fighting, we usually feel stressed, which isn't a great environment for discussing our feelings.
- Discussing emotions won't solve everything, of course. Sometimes, one person wants a baby and the other doesn't, and no amount of emotional sharing is going to make them agree. "But if you don't at least talk about your emotions," Heen said, "you'll just keep having the same argument over and over."
- Emotional intelligence comes from showing someone we have heard their emotions. But when we're in a conflict or a fight, simply showing often isn't enough. In those moments, everyone is skeptical and untrusting: Are they listening, or just preparing their rebuttal? Something more is needed, an extra step. To convince others we are genuinely listening during an argument, we must prove to them that we have heard them, prove we are working hard to understand, prove we want to see things from their perspective.
- So if a listener wants to prove they're listening, they need to demonstrate it after the speaker finishes talking. If we want to show someone we're paying attention, we need to prove, once that person has stopped speaking, that we have absorbed what they said. And the best way to do that is by repeating, in our own words, what we just heard them say—and then asking if we got it right.
- Then they summarized what they had heard: "What I hear you saying," said a woman from New York who identified as a liberal gun-control activist, "is that you've felt a lot of pain for most of your life, and it's been hard for you to express that pain, and that has made you push people away." "Exactly," Preston said. "When you grow up in the South, you're taught to avoid sharing your emotions, to not complain, don't be weak. But then you keep it all bottled up inside, and what leaks out instead is anger." "And now you want to let that pain go," the woman said. "Yeah," Preston replied. "It feels like such a relief to hear you say it that way." He took her hands. "Thank you for hearing me."
- Methods like looping for understanding, says Sheila Heen, are powerful because even when people lead very dissimilar lives, they can often find emotional similarities with one another. "We've all experienced fear and hope and anxiety and love," she told me. By creating an environment where people are invited to discuss their emotions, and then prove to one another they want to understand, we foster trust, even among people accustomed to seeing each other as foes.
- "That gun is my peace of mind," she said, "and when people say they want to take it away, what they're saying is they want me to feel powerless again." Someone in the group stepped in to summarize what they had heard: "You see your gun as a symbol that you won't let anyone hurt you. Did I get that right?" "It's proof that I deserve to feel safe," the woman said. "I belong here as much as anyone else."
- The idea of marriage and what people expected from their spouses—was changing. All of which caused the researchers to wonder: Why do some married couples stay happy for decades, even as society shifts around them, while others, who had once been so certain they were soulmates, descend into bickering and misery?
- So the researchers began looking for other variables that might explain what separated happy couples from unhappy marriages. One thing they had noticed was that many couples-both happy and unhappy-sometimes mentioned tussles over "control" when asked to describe their fights. "He always wants to control me," one woman told scientists during an interview. "He wants to trap me, get me to say things I don't want to say." That's usually why they started fighting, she explained, "because I want to make decisions for myself, and he wants to be in charge."
- Researchers noticed that many divorces happened after major life changes, in part because these changes had triggered a sense of losing control. Sometimes, it was the arrival of children or a stressful new job, which made it harder for people to control their time and anxiety.
- But happy and unhappy couples, the scientists saw, sought to assert control in very different ways. Among unhappy couples, the impulse for control often expressed itself as an attempt to control the other person. "You need to stop talking, right now!" one man shouted at his wife during a session taped by researchers. She yelled back: "Well, you need to stop working all the time, and ignoring your children, and treating us like shit just because you had a bad day!" Then she began detailing her demands, each of which took the form of an attempt to control his behavior: "You have to show up for dinner, and stop criticizing me, and ask about my day once in a goddamn while." Over the next forty-five minutes, both tried to control each other's language ("Don't use that tone with me!"), what topics they were allowed to discuss ("Don't even go there"), and which gestures should be allowed ("If you roll your eyes one more time, I'm leaving"). They divorced nine months later.
- Happy couples, for instance, spent a lot of time controlling their own emotions. They would take breaks when they felt themselves growing angry. They worked hard to calm down through deep breathing, or by writing down how they were feeling rather than shouting it, or by falling back on habits— using "I statements"; reciting a list of what they loved about each other; bringing up happy memories-that they had practiced during less angry times. They tended to speak more slowly, so they could stop, midsentence, if something came out harsher than they intended. They were more likely to defuse tensions by changing the subject or making jokes. "Happy couples slow down the fight," said Karney. "They exert a lot more self-control and self-awareness."
- Finally, happy couples seemed to concentrate more on controlling the boundaries of the conflict itself. "Happy couples, when they fight, usually try to make the fight as small as possible, not let it bleed into other fights," said Karney. But unhappy couples let one area of disagreement spill into everything else. "They start arguing about, 'Are we spending the holidays with my family or yours?' and pretty soon it becomes, 'You're so selfish, you never do the laundry, this is why we don't have enough money.' " (In marriage therapy, this is called kitchen-sinking, a particularly destructive pattern.)
- This explains why looping for understanding is so powerful: When you prove to someone you are listening, you are, in effect, giving them some control over the conversation. This is also why the matching principle is so effective: When we follow someone else's lead and become emotional when they are emotional, or practical when they have signaled a practical mindset, we are sharing control over how a dialogue flows.
- Emotions impact every conversation, whether we realize it or not. Even when we don't acknowledge those feelings, they're still there and when they are ignored, they're likely to become obstacles to connection. So a critical goal, in any meaningful discussion, is bringing emotions to the surface, which is the third rule of a learning conversation.
## **Third Rule: Ask about others' feelings, and share your own.**

- Deep questions are particularly good at creating intimacy because they ask people to describe their beliefs, values, feelings, and experiences in ways that can reveal something vulnerable. And vulnerability sparks emotional contagion, which makes us more aligned. Jeep questions can be as light as "What would be your perfect day?" or as leavy as "What do you regret most?" Deep questions don't always seem deep at first: "Tell me about your family" or "Why do you look so happy today?" easy to ask —and can be deep because they invite others to explain what makes them proud or worried, joyful or excited.
- Nearly any question can be remade into a deep question. The key is understanding three characteristics:

1. **A deep question asks about someone's values, beliefs, judgments, or experiences—rather than just facts.** Don't ask "Where do you work?" Instead, draw out feelings or experiences: "What's the best part of your job?" (One 2021 study found a simple approach to generating deep questions: Before speaking, imagine you're talking to a close friend. What question would you ask?)
2. **A deep question asks people to talk about how they feel.** Sometimes this is easy: "How do you feel about...?" Or, we can prompt people to describe specific emotions: "Did it make you happy when...?" Or ask someone to analyze a situation's emotions: "Why do you think he got angry?" Or empathize: "How would you feel if that happened to you?"
3. **Asking a deep question should feel like sharing.** It should feel, a bit, like we're revealing something about ourselves when we ask a deep question. This feeling might give us pause. But studies show people are nearly always happy to have been asked, and to have answered, a deep question.

When talking online, remember to...

- Overemphasize politeness. Numerous studies have shown that online tensions are lessened if at least one person is consistently polite. In one study, all it took was adding thanks and please to a series of online arguments-while everything else stayed the same to reduce tensions. 
- Underemphasize sarcasm. When we say something in a wry tone, it signals an irony our audience usually understands. When we type something sarcastic online, we typically hear these same inflections within our heads—but the people reading our comments do not.
- Express more gratitude, deference, greetings, apologies, and hedges. Studies demonstrate that when we are grateful ("That comment taught me a lot"), or solicitous ("I would love to hear your thoughts"), or preface comments with a greeting ("Hey!"), or apologize in advance ("I hope you don't mind...") or hedge our comments ("I think...' "), online communication gets better.
- Avoid criticism in public forums. In another study, researchers found that giving negative feedback online backfires much more than in real life. It pushes people to write more negative things, and to start criticizing others more frequently. When we criticize others publicly online, we make bad behavior into a digital norm.
# 6 - OUR SOCIAL IDENTITIES SHAPE OUR WORLDS

- Social identities, as one psychology textbook explains, are "that part of our self-concept that comes from our membership in social groups, the value we place on this membership, and what it means to us emotionally." Our social identities emerge from a blend of influences: The pride or defensiveness we feel based on the friends we've chosen, the schools we've attended, the workplaces we've joined. It's the obligations we feel because of our family legacies, how we grew up, or where we worship. All of us have a personal identity, how we think of ourselves apart from society. And all of us have a social identity, how we see ourselves—and believe others see us—as members of various tribes.
- Numerous studies have shown that social identities influence our thoughts and behaviors in profound ways. One famous experiment conducted in 1954 found that arbitrarily dividing eleven-year-old boys into two groups at a summer camp-they called themselves the Rattlers and the Eagles-was enough to cause them to start bonding intensely with their own faction, and then demonizing the other group until they were ripping down each other's flags and throwing rocks at one another's heads. Other experiments have demonstrated that, in social settings, people will lie about their pasts, willingly pay too much for a product, or pretend not to see a crime as it occurs simply to fit in.

- These identities nudge us and others to make ssumptions. They can subtly cause us to "exaggerate the differences between groups" and overemphasize "the similarities of things in the same group," as one researcher from the University of Manchester wrote in 2019. Our social identities push us unthinkingly to see people like us—what psychologists call our in-group—as more virtuous and intelligent, while those who are different— the out-group—as suspicious, unethical, and possibly threatening. Social identities help us relate to others, but they can also perpetuate stereotypes and prejudice.
- These kinds of discussions often help us bond: When we discover we both played high school basketball or both attend Star Trek conventions, we're more likely to trust each other. And though these tribal declarations might present downsides—we might look down upon people who weren't athletes, or who don't appreciate Spock—there are also clear benefits: When we discover overlapping social identities, we're more prone to connect.
- Over the years, as Dr. Rosenbloom encountered more and more parents who refused to vaccinate their children, it began to seem to him that their refusals were related to their social identities: We are skeptical about the medical establishment or We don't like the government telling us what to do. Part of it, he suspected, had to do with the environment where these discussions occurred: These patients were in his exam room, where he had been cast as the expert, and they were forced into the role of supplicants seeking advice, a dynamic that could easily trigger resentment. One study published in 2021 found that such power imbalances and other factors have caused "nearly one-fifth of Americans [to] self-identify as anti-vaxxers at least some of the time, and that many of these individuals view the label as central to their sense of social identity." Studies indicate that the vaccine resistant see themselves as smarter than the average person, better at critical thinking, and more devoted to natural health. Being anti- vaccine provides "psychological benefits," the 2021 study reads, including "increased self-esteem and a sense of community."
- The first study, conducted with a colleague named Steven Spencer and published in 1999, involved those women who were good at math. Steele knew, from surveys, that female math majors felt "that they have to prove themselves constantly, that their career commitment is questioned." Women were acutely aware of the stereotyped view that they were naturally less skilled at math than men—it was something, as Steele put it, "they knew they had to deal with." The fact that it had no basis in reality didn't make the stereotype any less pervasive.
- On the English tests, the men and women, on average, scored equally. On the math exams, however, men outscored women by an average of twenty points. During the English tests, both women and men budgeted their time wisely. On the math exam women seemed to work less efficiently. "They would double- check their answers more often and re-do calculations," Steele said. They ran out of time "because they were multitasking, with part of their brains trying to answer the questions, and part thinking, I need to double-check, I need to be careful, because I know there's this stereotype."
- The researchers wanted to see if "stereotype threat might be alleviated by reminding individual women of their multiple roles and identities," they later wrote. "A typical college woman might identify herself by her sex, race, ethnicity, social class, religion, sorority, class in school, job, athletic team, club membership, family.... Would it help the average woman's math performance to think about social identities other than being a woman, even if those other identities suggested no extraordinary math talent?"
- With this lesson in mind, Rosenbloom began a new routine: Whenever he met the parents of a patient, he spent a few minutes finding an identity they had in common. "If they talked about other family members, then I would mention my own family, or if they said they lived nearby, then I would say where I lived," he told me. "Doctors aren't supposed to discuss their personal lives, but I thought it was important to prove that we had a link." It might have seemed, to the patients, like he was trying to put them at ease. But he was also doing it for himself. "It reminded me I was more than a doctor," he said. "Then, when someone would say something irrational-like vaccines are a big plot-instead of getting annoyed, I felt some connection, because I know what it feels like to get pushed around by experts. I've experienced that."
- The league had been dreamed up by Salma Mousa, a PhD candidate at Stanford who was interested in testing what's known as the contact hypothesis— the theory that, if you bring people with clashing social identities together under specific conditions, you can overcome old hatreds. The idea that a soccer league might overcome deep enmities in Qaragosh, where a vast majority of Christian residents, when polled, said their Muslim neighbors had betrayed them, seemed preposterous. And, in fact, at the informational meeting, when coaches and players learned that half the teams would need to accept Muslim players, many walked out. "They told us this would ruin the teams," Mousa told me. "They said we were going to cause another war."
- The final reason this experiment worked is the same reason a Who Are We? conversation, if it goes well, succeeds: It allowed the players to form new in- groups, to establish social identities they had in common. And those in-groups were powerful because they built on identities that players already possessed. It might seem surprising, to an outsider, that Muslim and Christian players would bond so quickly. But it didn't wholly shock Mousa because she wasn't asking them to redefine themselves. She was simply making an identity they already carried-soccer teammates-more salient, and as a result their religious identities were a little less loud.
## How to Talk About Who We Are
1. Draw out multiple identities.
2.  Put everyone on equal footing.
3. Create new groups by building on existing identities.

# 7 - HOW DO WE MAKE THE HARDEST CONVERSATIONS SAFER?

- At Netflix, the culture deck explained, "we seek excellence," and in return, employees were granted unusual freedoms. Workers could take as much vacation as they wanted, work whichever days or hours they desired, authorize almost any kind of purchase a first-class plane ticket, a new computer, millions of dollars to acquire a film-without prior permission, as long as they could justify their choice.
- Employees who couldn't consistently deliver top-tier excellence were warned that a merely "adequate performance gets a generous severance package." And whenever someone was dismissed-which happened frequently —another Netflix ritual kicked in: A note was sent to that person's team, or department, or sometimes the entire company, explaining why the person had been let go. The departing employee's disappointing work habits, their questionable decisions and mistakes-all of it was spelled out in detail for everyone who remained. One current Netflix worker told me, "When I got to Netflix, I got a 'why Jim was fired' email on my second day, and I freaked out. It was very candid." He wondered, Did I make a mistake coming here? Is this place a snake pit? "But eventually I realized, it's actually helpful to get emails like that because, if you've read a few of them, you know what the company expects. It takes the mystery out of everything."
- The culture deck was amended to note that "silent disagreement is unacceptable." Hastings went so far as to tell workers that "it is disloyal to Netflix when you disagree with an idea and do not express that disagreement" and that they ought to "farm for dissent" among their peers. Before long, meetings were filled with people tearing apart one another's proposals. Teams would schedule "feedback dinners" where everyone would go around the table offering something they appreciated—-and the five or six things they did not appreciate about each of their coworkers.
- The controversy seemed to get bigger each week. Finally, months after th initial incident, Hastings told Friedland he had to leave. He then sent a "why Jonathan was fired" email to the entire company explaining that Friedland's "us of the n-word on at least two occasions at work showed unacceptably low racia awareness and sensitivity.... There is not a way to neutralize the emotion an history behind the word in any context." Hastings said that he regretted no acting sooner. 
- These kinds of comments sparked irritation because the listeners had been assigned to a group (the wealthy snobs, the selfish Republicans, the undeserving college students) they didn't identify with. Or, they were denied membership in a group (people who understand how the law works, people who sympathize with children where they felt they rightfully belonged. So the listener, offended, would become defensive as their sense of self-their identity-was attacked.
- **In psychology, this is known as identity threat, and it is deeply corrosive to communication. "When someone says you don't belong, or they put you in a group you don't appreciate, it can cause extreme psychological discomfort," Slepian told me.** Studies have shown that when people confront identity threats, their blood pressure can rise, their bodies can become flooded with stress hormones, they begin looking for ways to escape or fight back.
## SOME QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF BEFORE A CONVERSATION BEGINS

- How do you hope things will unfold? 
- How will this conversation start? 
- What obstacles might emerge? 
- When those obstacles appear, what is your plan to overcome them? 
- Finally, what are the benefits of this dialogue?

- However, when we describe our own experiences, feelings, and reactions— when we feel safe enough to reveal who we are—we start to neutralize identity threats. This requires some work, because avoiding generalizations means not only describing ourselves with honesty, but also listening closely to our companions so we can hear their specific pain and frustrations. We must not give in to the temptation to minimize someone's struggles, or try to solve their problems, simply because witnessing their discomfort is so difficult. We must not imply that, because we have not personally experienced their suffering, it therefore is not real.

 **Guidelines for Hard Conversations**

1. **Begin with guidelines:** Start the conversation by discussing what is acceptable and what is out of bounds.
2. **Acknowledge discomfort:** Recognize that the conversation may be challenging and make people uncomfortable—and that is okay.
3. **Accept mistakes:** Understand that mistakes will happen. The goal is not perfection, but curiosity and understanding.
4. **Share, don’t persuade:** The purpose is to share your experiences and perspectives, not to convince others to change their minds.
5. **Avoid blaming and shaming:** No blaming, shaming, or personal attacks.
6. **Speak from your own experience:** Share your own views and experiences; do not describe what others think.
7. **Maintain confidentiality:** Confidentiality is important. People must feel safe, knowing their words won’t be repeated.
8. **Show respect:** Respect is essential. Even if you disagree, show respect for each person's right to be heard.
9. **Pause if needed:** Difficult conversations may be re-traumatizing. Go slow, and encourage participants to pause or step away if necessary. Discomfort is normal, but pain or trauma is a signal to stop.

- One of the employees who helped organize internal petitions about the Chappelle special told me that "these kinds of conversations always have a lot of heated emotions," but that Netflix has learned how to have them. "We had a big town hall after all this started, and the rules were made clear at the beginning: Everyone was allowed to talk, but no shaming or blaming or attacks. You had to think before you spoke. You had to contribute, rather than just criticize." During that meeting, people critiqued the company's leadership to their faces, "and trans employees talked about what they had experienced at the company and what needed to change," the employee said. "And there were other people saying, 'I don't agree with you on everything, but thank you, I understand you're hurting and I'm committed to having this conversation.' It felt like a real dialogue."

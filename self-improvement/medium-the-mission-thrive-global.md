## Surround Yourself with People Who Hold You to a Higher Standard than You Hold Yourself
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/surround-yourself-with-people-who-hold-you-to-a-higher-standard-than-you-hold-yourself-96f12c186375)

- People select their friends based on proximity more than anything else.
- In a college classroom, you do not make friends exactly with those who share similar interests, but those who you literally sit next to.
- A person's economic mobility is highly determined by the country they live in.
- Do your close friends hold you to a high standard? Or do they hold you to an even lower standard than you hold yourself?
- Most people are willing to tolerate unhealthy relationships, poor finances, and jobs they hate. If not so, those things wouldn't be in their lives.
- If your environment radically contradicts the goals you're trying to pursue, your life will always be an uphill battle.
- Ex: buying a new car, after getting it and posting videos of the car, he got 2000 friend requests, higher sales of his real estate education products, he was seen as "credible". Driving around in the coolest car made him feel awesome.
- *Precognition: that you can predict your own psychological/emotional state by targeting biological or environmental stimuli.*
  - This is why you work in environments that create amazing feelings.
  - He was seeing the fruits of his labors.
  - He was consciously generating a self-fulfilling prophecy in real-tie. He created an environment that was now creating him.
  - These fruits added even more confidence, creating a continuous confidence building feedback loop.
- *Confidence does not come from owning a Tesla. But the external and the internal play off each other. When you change your external environment, it alters your psychology, which then can loop back to continuing to enhance the environment in a virtuous upward cycle.*

### Surround Yourself with People Who Transform You

- Hired Ryan Holiday to help me with the book, when I send him a draft, he shows how it could be 10x better, and he holds me to that standard.
- It's more that I don't know what I don't know. Working with Ryan has streamlined my understanding of what is possible and what it takes to create something powerful.
- ***By investing in what you're doing, you'll experience the psychological shift needed to achieve your goals.*** Once invested, your identity towards what you are doing changes. You've put yourself physically, not just emotionally, in a position where you must move forward.
- ***Surrounding yourself with people who have higher standards than you is the fastest way to change. If you don't change your environment, and instead attempt to overcome your environment through willpower, you'll lose every time.***

- Same with romantic relationships. Do they help you more than you become more than you currently are? Do you help them?
- 20% of people are moving forward, 60% mimics, and 20% is moving backward.
- You've been around people who, simply by being around them, elevated your thinking and energy. Those are the kinds of people you need to surround yourself with. Those are the kinds of people you need to be like yourself, so that others are better simply by being around you.
- **The quality of your life and the quality of your work is determined by the standards you have for yourself, and the standards of those around you. If you're fine doing mediocre work, then those around you are as well.**

## I Quit Social Media For 30 Days and Here’s What I Learned
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/i-quit-social-media-for-30-days-and-heres-what-i-learned-930795e784ef)

- Aziz: "Whenever you check for a new post on Instagram or whenever you go on The New York Times to see if there's a new thing, it's not even about the content. It's just about seeing a new thing. You get addicted to that feeling."
- *What have I lost from the last decade of my life in exchange for a whole bunch of probably obsessive checking of Facebook?*
- Facebook--for sharing big news, for information recall.
- Books--after quitting social media, you'll miss reading them.

## Why Most People Will Never Be Successful
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-most-people-will-never-be-successful-632bb24fa5c3)

- Your days must consistently be spent on high quality activities. The more successful you become--which is balancing the few essential things (spiritual, relational, financial, physical) in your life and removing everything else, the less you can justify low quality.
- As your vision for yourself expands, you realize you have to make certain adjustments. You need to cut-back on spending all of your money and time on crap and entertainment.
- Not about perfection, not about being busy all the time.
- **How you do anything is how you do everything.** This only makes sense for people who have removed everything from their lives they hate. Your daily and normal life can only be filled with those things you highly value.
- When your days are filled with only those core essentials that mean the world to you, you will dominate in "all" areas of your life. Because the only things in your life are the things you highly value. (This is hard!)
- "A lot of people don’t do well simply because they major in minor things." Said another way, most people are caught in the thick of thin things.

## Mediocrity is a Virus. Here’s How to Banish it from Your Life.
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/mediocrity-is-a-virus-heres-how-to-banish-it-from-your-life-52a618c93391)

- When you justify and allow even little things into your life which your intuition warns you against, you permit a virus to enter your life. It spreads to other areas.
- Going against your higher intuitive voice is a slippery-slope. You don’t realize day to day how out of whack things are really getting.
- "A private victory always precedes a public victory." — Stephen R. Covey
- "When a man makes his thoughts pure, he no longer desires impure food." — James Allen
- If you want to improve your finances, you have to change your desires about money. You can’t continue to enjoy spending money on the crap you spend it on. You can’t continue to be content always being stressed about money.
- If you no longer desire mediocrity, you won't be mediocre. Herein lies a subtle and disarming truth — everything you have in your life is what you want. If you wanted something different, you'd have something different. As James Allen wrote, your circumstances reveal you.
- If you really wanted to believe something different, you'd be actively seeking to learn, to alter, and to replace your current set of beliefs.
- You'd no longer justify your behavior. You'd be more open, honest, and authentic about where you're at. Ironically, you’d also be more accepting of where you’re at. Acceptance is the first step to commitment.
- *No excuses. If you need to learn something new, you’ll learn it. If you need to behave differently, you will. If you need a new environment, you reshape your circumstances.*
- True learning always occurs in an experiential way. It's never purely theoretical. Just like creativity rarely happens while sitting at your desk, deep and transformational learning will rarely happen within the confines of your cushy and comfortable routine.
- You'll be stunned by how low your personal standards have been. You'll be shocked what you've been willing to tolerate.
- Own your value system: most people are too concerned about what other people think to be their true selves.
- Doing burpees randomly: HE WANTS TO DO BURPEES. HE DOESN'T CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK.
- Make a private decision followed by a public commitment of what you intend to do. Surround yourself with the right people who will keep you accountable.

## How To Deal With Uncomfortable Emotions And Reshape Your Identity
[Reference](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/how-to-deal-with-uncomfortable-emotions-and-reshape-your-identity-34f878cf69fa)

- Pain, discomfort, shock, boredom, impostor syndrome, awkwardness, fear, being wrong, failing, ignorance, looking stupid: your avoidance of these feelings is stopping you from a life beyond your wildest imagination.
- *Wealth, optimal health, incredible relationships, and deep spiritual maturity are all available to you. But you have to pay the price to have these things. The primary obstacle in your way is how you feel about what you need to do to have these things.*
- Most people aren't willing to feel difficult emotions on a regular basis.
- When you feel the fear and do it anyways, you get the satisfaction of living life on your terms. Instead of being a hostage to your emotions, you get to experience them more deeply.
- *Hilariously, once you break past the emotional blocks and just act, it’s never as bad as you think it will be.*
- Napoleon Hill said, "When your desires are strong enough, you will appear to possess superhuman powers to achieve." Similarly, Tim Grover has said, "When you crave the end result, the hard work becomes irrelevant."
- *When the why is strong enough, you'll be willing to do any how. The clearer and bigger the why, thee bolder the how.*
- Taking cold showers = great practice. Even after doing it for years, I still often experience a moment of resistance.
- "Wow, I'm really doing this." Your beliefs and identity will change. They'll follow your courageous behaviors.
- Better to live in an environment you created than something created for you.
- *If you want something different, you need to act different. It doesn't matter how you feel in the moment.*

## 30 Behaviors That Will Make You Unstoppable
[Reference](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/30-behaviors-that-will-make-you-unstoppable-ae749e04443e)

- Don't think, know and act. "Every right decision I have ever made has come from my gut. Every wrong decision I've made was the result of me not listening to the greater voice of myself."
- Always be prepared so you have the freedom to act on instinct. With enhanced consciousness, time will slow down for you.
- Don't be motivated by money or by anything external.
- Never be satisfied. *It is not about the goal. It's about the climb to see how far you can push yourself.* Does this make you ungrateful? Absolutely not. You’re entirely humbled and grateful for everything in your life. Which is why you will never get complacent or lazy.
- Always be in control. Act based on instinct, not impulse. Just because you could doesn't mean you do. And when you do, it's because you want to, not because you have to.
- Be true to yourself. When something isn't right in your life, change it. Immediately.
- Never let off the pressure. *You never take the pressure off yourself.*
- Don't be afraid of the consequences of failure. Whatever man.
- Don't compete with others. Make them compete with you.
- Never stop learning. *Ordinary people seek entertainment. Extraordinary people seek education and learning.*
- Success isn't enough, it only increases the pressure.
- Don't get crushed by success. There is no destination.
- Completely own it when you screw up. No blame. No deception or illusion. Just the cold hard truth. When you mess up, you own it. And as the leader, you own it when your team fails. Only with extreme ownership can you have complete freedom and control.
- Let your work speak for itself. Deep work: rare, high value, AND NOT REPLICABLE. If anyone can do it, then it is shallow work.
- *Always work on your mental strength.* "Mental resilience is arguably the most critical trait of a world-class performer, and it should be nurtured continuously. Left to my own devices, I am always looking for ways to become more and more psychologically impregnable. When uncomfortable, my instinct is not to avoid the discomfort but to become at peace with it. My instinct is always to seek out challenges as opposed to avoiding them." — Josh Waitzkin
- Confidence is your greatest asset. Running a marathon is far more mental than physical.
- Surround yourself with people who remind you of the future, not the past.
- Let things go, but never forget. Forgiveness improves not only your emotional health, but also your physical health.
- Have clear goals. Either on behaviors or on the outcomes you're seeking. For most people, behaviorally-focused goals are the better and more motivating option. But when you crave the results so much that the work is irrelevant, your aim should be directed straight at the outcomes you want.
- Respond immediately--he who hesitates is lost.
- Choose simplicity over complication. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.
- Never be jealous or envious of someone else's accomplishments.
- Take the shot every time. If I fail more than you, I win.
- Don't get caught up in the results of your success. Always remain focused on what got you those results: the work.
- Think at 10x. *When you take your goal of earning 100K this year and change it to 1M, you're forced to operate at a different level.* Are you willing to go for 10x thinking? Are you willing to question your own thought processes and open yourself to believing an entirely different set of possibilities?
- Set goals that exceed your current capabilities. You need to aim beyond what you are capable of. You need to develop a complete disregard for where your abilities end. If your goals are logical, they won't force you to create luck. Being unstoppable means your goals challenge you to be someone more than you currently are.

## 6 Things You Need to Recover From Every Day
[Reference](https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy/6-things-you-need-to-recover-from-every-day-380f20a90f6c)

- Work.
  - Recovering from work: completely refraining from work-related activities and thoughts during non-work time. F email.
  - People who are successful in their work are often content being "unsuccessful" in the other areas of their lives, particularly their relationships.
- Technology.
  - Individuals who stopped staring at screens 1-2 hours before sleep: higher sleep quality and higher ability to maintain enthusiasm.
  - Try avoiding technology for the first 30-60 minutes of waking.
  - Avoid smartphone use for 1-2 hours before sleep.
- People.
  - 20-60 minutes per day to think, reflect, ponder, and plan.
  - We all need time with people and time alone.
- **Food.**
  - You should be fasting from food for at least 18-24 hours on a weekly basis. When you fast, or "recover" from food, your body is given the opportunity to repair and rebuilt itself, rather than constantly digesting.
  - Increases levels of dopamine which elevates your happiness and confidence.
  - A 16-hour fast can reset your sleep cycle.
  - Being on an empty stomach helps you think and focus better. Hence, many people purposely skip breakfast so they can better focus on their creative work.
  - Fasting stabilizes your emotions. This happens by detaching from the emotional dependence on food.
  - Fasted state improves focus, memory, and ability to comprehend information.
- **Exercise.**
  - Shorter but more intensive exercise. Intensive activity followed by high quality rest and recovery.
  - Wherever you are, make sure you are there.
  - Sleep: increased memory, longer life, decreased inflammation, increased creativity, increased attention and focus, decreased fat and increased muscle mass, lower stress, decreased dependence on stimulants like caffeine, decreased risk of getting into accidents...

## Focus On Learning and Creating Rather Than Being Entertained and Distracted
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/focus-on-learning-and-creating-rather-than-being-entertained-and-distracted-e6573de1bc84)

- Most people are distracted while they're at work. They're distracted when they're with family and friends. They're distracted at the gym, on their commute, and even in the shower.
- Most people don't prioritize learning and creating. They don't care enough to invest in their personal development and growth.
- **Entertainment and distraction is the enemy of creation and learning. They will keep you in mediocrity. If you don't want to end up living a life of mediocrity, focus on learning and education.**
- The extent of the struggle determines the extent of the growth. Formal education makes a living, but self-education makes a fortune.
- Most people will continue to go through life "in quiet desperation", with their songs left unsung. Others dictate their income, their happiness, and their fulfillment.

### We Attract Into Our Lives What We Are

- **Any woman like that wouldn't want to have anything to do with someone like him!**
- You must become a far better version of yourself to achieve the enormous success you want.
- If you want a million dollars, do you have the mindset of a millionaire? **Do you have the financial knowledge and self-discipline to own that kind of money?**
- Every day, millions of people attract mediocre opportunities, not realizing they are attracting who they are!
- If you constantly engage in mediocre, low-frequency activities with toxic individuals, you'll only receive similar opportunities. You'll never experience the type of success of the world's most extraordinary people, because success is something you attract by the person you become.
- Safety or freedom? You can't have both.
- We trade our genius and artistry for apparent stability.
- "The goal of life is not to relax on the beach, sipping mojitos all day. The purpose is to find something you love that adds value to the world." -Ben Foley
- Your days must consistently be spent on high quality activities.
- **Have I improved 1% on physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health?**
- If you want to live an extraordinary life, you need to give up a normal one.
- **You can reasonably spend time with just about anyone. You can reasonably eat anything placed in front of you. You can reasonably justify activities and behaviors that are, frankly, mediocre.**
- You can't continue being with low-frequency, negative people. You can't keep eating crappy foods that slow you down. You can't do many of the things you used to do. **This is what extraordinary requires. Most people see the price and simply say "no thanks". But anything is possibly if you pay the price.**
- If your lifestyle does not add to your healing, it will subtract from it.

## How to Become the Best in the World at What You Do
[Reference](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/how-to-become-the-best-in-the-world-at-what-you-do-7d3e918780dd)

- Getting to Ramen profitable: practice and putting yourself out there. Quantity became quality. And then they put something out that people loved.
-  Coaching/education. Mentors that have changed how I write. Virtual online course. **You'll know when you're ready for the next level, because you'll make the proper investments in the teachers to help you get there.** Your level of commitment can directly be measured by how invested you are.
- Create your own rules. Restructure the game to automate your success.
- Consistency. It is the most fundamental virtue to becoming the person you want to be. Anyone can sprint, but everything meaningful in life is a marathon--meant to test your commitment and will.
- Learn from people who have actually been there, as opposed to sideline spectators. Never take advice from someone you wouldn't want to switch places with.
- Being holistic about your art.
  - Journalling: to capture all the work your subconscious has been doing while you were sleeping.
  - Or get to the project you were working on.
  - “Pain and other chronic symptoms are physical manifestations of unresolved internal conflict. Symptoms surface as the instinctual mechanism for self-survival. They are messages from the inner self wanting to be heard, but ego takes center-stage, and hides the truth within the shadows of the unconscious mind: which is the body.”
- Pre-performance routine to get you into the zone.
- Cycling is a sport notorious for the amount of suffering required. As Tyler Hamilton has said, “I discovered when I went all out, when I put 100 percent of my energy into some intense, impossible task — when my heart was jack-hammering, when lactic acid was sizzling through my muscles — that’s when I felt good, normal, balanced.”
- Cyclists often refer to “the pain cave,” which is a mental place they go deeper and deeper into as they’re competing. “I went deeper than I thought I would.” “I was at the limit.” “I was totally pinned.” You often hear phrases like these in interviews after a cycling race.
- “Mental resilience is arguably the most critical trait of a world-class performer, and it should be nurtured continuously. Left to my own devices, I am always looking for ways to become more and more psychologically impregnable. When uncomfortable, my instinct is not to avoid the discomfort but to become at peace with it. My instinct is always to seek out challenges as opposed to avoiding them.” — Josh Waitzkin
- When you begin feeling uncomfortable, that’s when you start feeling good. That’s when you’re growing. No pain no gain. That’s your happy place. That’s where most people stop. But not you.
- Do it because of love.

## How to Consistently Act From Your Deepest “Why” and Optimize Your Time
[Reference](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/how-to-make-the-best-possible-use-of-your-time-335f15ecbefd)

- It is the norm to waste large portions of one’s time.
- Most people have very low standards for how they use their time.
- They don’t have clarity about where they should direct their attention.
- They haven’t created conditions to get clear on a daily basis.
- They don’t believe they deserve to spend their time on ONLY those things which fascinate, challenge, and motivate them.
- They haven’t discovered nor clarified their deepest held motivations, both for specific goals and for their life in general.
- They act and operate from their base-level reasons, which aren’t inspiring.
- Hence, most people’s time is spent either on stuff that literally irritates them, or at best, is merely “okay.”

### Your Life Is A Reflection Of What You Believe You Deserve

- Subconsciously, you believe you are "unworthy" of anything beyond what you currently have. Unworthy to have more, to contribute more, to experience more, to connect deeper.
- What if you decided to eat ONLY healthy foods?
- You raise the bar on what you believe you're worth.
- You raise the standards for: the type of person you want to be, the quality of work you want to do, the types of people you want to be around, the way you spend your time, and the lifestyle you have.
- Elevating your sense of what you deserve isn't about entitlement. It's about growth. At the deepest level, it's about giving and gratitude, the hallmarks of abundance.

### Seeing The Forest For The Trees

- The worm's-eye view: day-to-day routine for focus.
- the bird's eye view: the direction you're headed, and why.
- Because most people lack clarity, they aren't even sawing the right tree. Because people have low standards for themselves, they're fine spending large portions of time doing work that isn't making an impact. They prefer not getting stuff done.
- Sacred place to do the activities that will elevate you for the day: in his case, the car.

### Why do you want this?

- Clarity leads to motivation. Operating from your deepest conviction creates authentic and optimal performance.
- What about `___` is important to me?
  - Working from home: because I am as effective working from home as I am from the office.
  - Flexible schedule: because I do my best work in the deep evening.

## If You Don’t Believe In Setting Goals, It’s Because You Don’t Know How To Do It
[Reference](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/if-you-dont-believe-in-setting-goals-it-s-because-you-don-t-know-how-to-do-it-96e7dbacca6d)

- Faith: having a belief or hope in something that you can't see or something that doesn't currently exist.
- People with a fixed mindset really have a really, really hard time learning. Why learn if you don't believe you can actually learn and evolve?
- There is a dominant learning style. You don't have strengths or weaknesses per se, but you have positive or negative learning habits.
- If you look at yourself in the mirror and believe in that person, then you are empowered. If you believe you can learn anything, you can. Are some things going to be harder to learn than others for you? Of course, but not because of fixed strengths and weaknesses, but because of atrophied or underdeveloped learning muscles, sabotaging beliefs, and bad habits.
- When you believe in yourself, you love the person looking back at you in the mirror.
- "My hero is me in 10 years."
- What you need to achieve any goal:
  - Clear goal, the more specific the better.
  - You need to actually want that goal.
  - You need to believe you can actually achieve your goal.
  - 100% commitment to your goal. Until you become 100% committed to your goal, there's hesitancy. If you're hesitating, you're ineffective. You're not completely absorbed. You're not reflecting, acting, analyzing, deciding, and thinking about all the ways you can accomplish your goal.

## Work On Yourself, Not On Your Job
[Reference](https://medium.com/personal-growth/want-to-become-the-best-at-what-you-do-read-this-10b6a79feda9)

- Your work is a reflection of you. If you're not getting the results you're looking for, stop looking for better strategies. Are you currently the person who would attract the level of success you seek?
- A significant of your energy should be devoted to your job, rest, and self-improvement.
- Putting yourself in situations others can only dream of: you have to put yourself in demanding situations--situations that humble and scare you. How to do this? Initiate. Don't wait for life to come to you. Don't wait for the next opportunity. Improve your current situation or job by providing actual value. Pitch ideas. Ask questions. Try and fail. Take on roles that require greater responsibility.
- "Leadership" - you just need to assume that role. Do this enough, and continuously pitch yourself and your ideas, and you'll create opportunities. You can then maximize those opportunities and more will come.
- Don't copy other people, make them copy you.
- Stay in love with the process.
  - The process or the work itself is all there is. Results come and go. And it's never been about the results. Success is inevitable.
  - **Success comes easy because it's the last thing on your mind. You already know it's going to happen.**
  - The work itself, and becoming better and better at it, is what drives you. It almost doesn't matter what you're doing. It's why you're doing it that matters.
  - When you are in love with the process, you seek feedback, mentoring, and coaching--even when you're at the top of your game.
  - You surround yourself with people who aren't afraid to tell you the truth. You avoid people who suck-up and only tell you what they think you want to hear.
  - Self-transcendence comes from collaborating with others who are driven by a greater and grander vision. When the whole becomes fundamentally different than the sum of its parts. When the work is the reward.
- Why are we doing this again?
  - Do not break your personal rules "just this once". In our minds, we can justify these small choices. None of those things, when they first happen, feels like a life-changing decision, but they roll up into a much bigger picture.

## Tell Me What You Did Today, And I'll Tell You Who You Are

- When you don't act in accordance with your values and goals, you're internally conflicted. You know you should be doing something: working on your project, being present with your loved ones, eating healthy, and you knowingly act in contradictory ways.
- Being internally-conflicted: checking Facebook/Twitter, eating bad, and going days without writing. Perfection shouldn't be the objective. However, consistency and implementation of our values and goals creates substantial momentum and results.
- "We live our lives in 24 hour periods: on the things that we did today, did we act like the person we wish to become?"
- Ideal day thing?
  - 7-8 hours of deep and healthy sleep.
  - Less than 300 calories of junk food, one meal each day eaten with wife and kids.
  - 30-60 minutes of exercise.
  - 15-30 minutes of prayer/meditation.
  - 3-5 hours of undistracted writing (no email).
  - 2+ undistracted hours with my kids.
  - 1+ undistracted hours one-on-one with my wife.
- Motivation and self-regulation theory.
  - If you're lacking motivation, there's a problem with your goals. Wrong goals, not specific enough, or the timeline isn't definitive enough.
- Self-regulation:
  - Self-monitoring: how well we are currently performing.
  - Self-evaluation: how well we are performing compared to our goals.
  - Self-reaction: determines how we think and feel comparative to our goals.
- When I get distracted, I pull out my journal and write my goals. This reignites my motivation and serves as my course-correction.
- You can't just want to succeed. You have to plan and prepare for the worst.
- You will get derailed often. You need to prepare for those moments you're not motivated. You do this by creating triggers that automatically reignite your motivation.
- How you spend each day is a clear indicator of who you are and who you will become. It's not enough to simply want a better future. You need to know what that future looks like, and start living that way today.

## How To Tell If Someone Is Truly Smart Or Just Average
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-tell-if-someone-is-truly-smart-or-just-average-a2f0bcac5db2)

- Musk: sees people as computers, and he sees his brain software as the most important product he owns--and since there aren't any companies out there designing brain software, he designed his own, tests it every day, and makes constant updates.
- Ray Dalio: record everyone and allow anyone to rate any other employee in real time. This data is then added to profiles that each employee can see and is subsequently fed into an artificial intelligence system.
- Charles Munger: cognitive bias checklist before making investment decisions to ensure he properly applies the correct mental models.
- Warren Buffett : decision trees.
- Charlie Munger: mental models.
- Bezos/Zuckerberg: experimentation engine.
- When I consider new business ideas, instead of just imagining how great they're going to be, I spend just as much time envisioning what could go wrong--another Munger hack. No need to remind myself to think this way anymore.
- Mental models:
  - For great thinkers, using mental models is conscious and proactive.
  - Musk: It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree, make sure you understand the fundamental principles before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang onto.
  - 20% of inputs lead to 80% of outputs.
- Tools:
  - The difference between us and people from 30K years ago. Only 30% of the population could read and write before the printing press was invented in 1440.
  - People who are able to model how this more complex reality works will be far more successful at navigating it.
  - People who are able to model how a complex business works in their minds are more likely to be successful business leaders, because they must understand finance, HR, product dev, marketing/sales, interacting with the mental models of their stakeholders.
  - When building a house, you need: electrical, plumbing, design, materials, pricing, to make a beautiful building.
- Mental model collectors:
  - Many of the world's problems result from people overgeneralizing from simplistic models just like our hypothetical one-size-fits-all "dog".
    - Black/white thinking: you're a good or a bad person.
    - Us/them thinking: people that aren't like you are your enemy.
    - Stereotypes.
  - Great thinkers: grandmasters have memorized no less than 50,000 chunks of increasing complexity including openings, closings, patterns.

- Expert generalist: "Someone who has the ability and curiosity to master and collect expertise in many different disciplines, industries, skills, capabilities, countries, topics."
- Expert generalists:
  - See the world more accurately and make better predictions of the future.
  - Have more breakthrough ideas.
- Two-Track analysis means considering:
  - How people act if they behaved rationally, according to their true best interests.
  - How they would succumb to the pull of a number of irrational psychological biases that seem to be "programmed" into the human brain.

## 5-Hour Rule: If you’re not spending 5 hours per week learning, you’re being irresponsible

- Automated vehicle fleets will eliminate one of our biggest purchases: a car. Virtual reality will make expensive experiences, such as going to a concert or playing golf, instantly available at much lower cost.
- Education and health care costs have risen but they will lower costs at some point when we get exclusive online, training for in-demand, high-paying skills, or having employers who recruit students subsidize the cost of tuition.
- At-risk people: those with no skills. They risk remaining stuck on the bottom rung of global competition, and they risk losing their jobs to automation.
- **There are no lack of jobs. There is a lack of skilled workers for those jobs.**
- Knowledge is the new money.

### Essential Skills

- Identify valuable knowledge at the right time.
- Learn and master that knowledge quickly.
- Communicate the value of your skills to others. Convincing others is a "multiplier skill."
- Convert knowledge into money and results.
- Learn how to financially invest in learning to get the highest return: we need the right portfolio of books, courses, degrees to help us achieve our goals within our budget.
- Learning how to learn.

## 40 Ways to Live a Full Life By Age 30

- **Do ridiculous things.** Getting a dog.
- **What will teach me the most?**
- **Quit dicking around.** 30 years, 1 year is so much time. Wake up every day and do a little more, dick around a little less.
- **The right time is right now.**
- **Get married, be in a long term relationship.**
- **Stay clear of charlatans and the toxic.** Unfollow, delete, purge. If a media site sucks, stop listening. If service at a restaurant sucks, don't go there. No need to be rude, but just don't do it.
- **Keep a journal.** This is to force you to think about what you're doing right now.
- **Hell yes or hell no is too simple.**
- **Live in a city, but not for too long.**
- **The quiet moments are the best.** It's in the quiet, still moments that we feel what matters in life. Standing on the shore of a lake, looking out over a canyon.
- **Have a philosophy.** Don't just wing things. Live by something.
- **Study real philosophy too.**
- **Exercise.**
- **Don't compare yourself to other people.** Who cares if they were first?
- **Sooner is not better.** Accomplishments don't change who you are. Where did numbers for age goals come from?
- **Meditate on your mortality.**
- **Don't live like every day is your last.** Live like it's the last day before a deployment: you'll handle your business, you'll spend time with your loved ones.
- **Travel with purpose.** You go to other places to learn about things, and what did you learn there, that you couldn't have gotten from some other source? What did you really do?
- **Be prematurely old.** I think it's better to have your shit together. Young people are stupid, old people are wise.
- **The law of diminishing returns.** Be willing to call things when the diminishing returns set in, it's how you move on when others are stuck.
- **Study the lives of the greats.**
- **Don't waste time being offended.** How much precious energy is spilled fighting online?
- **Buy a house.** It's something you want to get back to.
- **Work a lot.** Yeah, you won't be happy on your deathbed, but relative to what? Playing video games, going to restaurants, or chasing girls/boys? If you think what you do contributes to the world, then you should feel content and accomplished.
- **Don't be a hater.** What's the sense?
- **You can do no whatever you want.** No need to conform to needless constraints.

- It’s actually far more exhausting to not work than it is to work. It takes far more energy to sit with internal conflict than it does to get to work.”
- Changing your negative behaviors might seem like more work, but in the long run, it actually saves you energy, time, and money than if you never changed.
- Evolving into better versions of yourself allows you to be more productive, focused, creative, energized, and fulfilled. Shedding old habits that only held you back will allow you to experience some of the deepest fulfillment of your life so far.
- “When you build a habit, you don’t have to spend mental energy deciding what to do.” - David Kadavy
- Giving yourself this little out makes the process of quitting 100x harder.
- "If you want lasting change, you have to give up this idea of just trying something, and you have to commit yourself to mastery. That means not just "dabbling," but fully immersing yourself. Because your life is not controlled by what you do some of the time, but by what you do consistently." - Tony Robbins
- "Disbelief is negative power. When the mind disbelieves or doubts, the mind attracts reasons to support the disbelief." - David Schwartz
- Are my goals as big as they should be?
- If I expanded my goals 10x bigger, what would happen?
- Do I believe I can succeed? Or am I just pretending?

## 23 Smart Ways to Increase Your Confidence, Productivity, and Income
[Reference](https://medium.com/personal-growth/23-smart-ways-to-increase-your-confidence-productivity-and-income-c21b42979893)

- **Deal with 5 minutes of pain.** Waking up only really feels terrible for 5 minutes, if you immediately get out of bed and do something.
  - The longer you hesitate to do something, the less likely you are likely to do it.
  - You know you are lying to yourself. If you do things that you say you are going to do, then that is a cause, not an effect. You gain confidence by doing what you say you're going to do.
  - You want to make decisions when you are in a good mental state. You want to start off your day in a good mental state.
  - This usually only lasts 5 minutes. Change environments as quickly as possible.
  - Sometimes, improvements are about changing the first 5 minutes of your day, or just having 30 days to build a habit.
- **Start your day with your #1 priority.**
- **Face your resistance/do what you're avoiding.**
  - When you get yourself to work on what's the most important for you, you can feel a surge of energy toward the other important stuff in your life.
- **Embrace multiple learning styles.**
  - Everyone has a dominant learning style, and we also have backup learning styles we rely on when we're in a difficult situation.
  - When you engage in an activity that you resist, you activate areas of your brain and emotions that you've suppressed.
  - You make new connections in your brain, and confidence in yourself by watching yourself do something difficult.
  - Growth mindset over fixed mindset.
- **How you do anything is how you do everything.**
  - You can't eat a chocolate cake and want to be slim.
- **Know and strategically define your why.**
  - "He who has a why to live for can bear almost any why."
  - Clarity leads to motivation, operating from conviction creates authentic and optimal performance.
  - What about so-and-so is important to me?
  - What about working from home is important to me? What about having a flexible schedule is important to me? Keep on asking why, why, why.
- **Be a giver, not a matcher or a taker.**
- **Only engage in transformational relationships, because transactional ones will end soon anyways.**
- **Don't overvalue what you contribute to your relationships while undervaluing what others contribute.** Don't keep score in your relationships.
- **Work with craftsmen, not salesmen.**
  - People who have high standards for their work.
  - Those who lack details in their work lack important details in the design of the other areas of their lives.
  - Craftsmen and professionals. Their priority is doing brilliant work, but they aren't starving artists. They understand the business side as well.
- **Elevate your sense for what you deserve in your life.**
  - There is an ocean of abundance, and one can tap into it with a teaspoon, a bucket, or a tractor trailer. The ocean doesn't care.
  - **Your life is a reflection of what you believe you deserve.** Your sense of what you deserve grows as you have a greater desire to help other people. You end up needing to use your time better, because you have important work to do.
  - Expectancy theory:
    - How bad you want something, how much you believe you can actually have, or do what you want, and your belief that the means by which you seek your goal will actually bring about the desired result.
    - Our eyes only see and our ears only hear what our brain is looking for.
    - Developing skills becomes an upward cycle of expectancy: you KNOW you can do more, you've watched yourself grow and transform, and you have higher and higher standards for yourself.
- **Elevate your sense for what you can contribute, because if you're willing to work and learn, you can do masterful things.**
  - Mastery comes from embracing difficult emotions. You'll face difficult emotions, because in order to gain true master, you must understand all sides of something.
  - Integrating, understanding, all of these require embracing all of the learning styles, breaking emotional blocks, expanding your sense for what you can do.
  - The more education a person gets, the more empathetic they can become. There is no power in ignorance.
- **Decide what kind of life you want, then figure out how to get it.**
  - Instead of "living within your means", why not proactively decide what you want, and then figure out how to get it.
  - On money: if you can have nice things, and not fear having them taken away, then it's a good thing. Because money is a really valuable tool.
  - Rather than fitting your dreams into your current lifestyle, fit your lifestyle around your dreams.
- **Serve and give as much as you can.**
  - Giving: you want to do this because you genuinely want to help other people, and you want to have a clear conscience.
  - You give because you must. You give of yourself, and organize your life to give so you can have a clear consciousness of how you're living your life.
- **Automate your income as quickly as possible to free up time.**
  - Courage: if you want to work in an environment where you are compensated based on your performance (business owner or employee paid on an incentive basis).
- **Give 10x value of what you say you will, aka blow people's minds..**
  - Passive income: you give way more than what people pay for. You focus on value, not price. When you focus on value, you can actually charge very large sums of money, because you know people will get at least 10x the value of what they paid for.
  - When you're a giver, you MUST give more value than people pay. You do it because you find joy in doing your very best work, you do it because you value the fact that people came to you.
- **Give away most of your work for free.**
  - Give away a lot of things for free. Your free stuff should also be valuable that it makes people want to come back for more.
- **Make more stuff, but only really good stuff.**
  - Ship often. Ship lousy stuff, but ship. Ship constantly.
  - Self-perception is the product of choices and environments.
  - If you want more creativity, then you simply need to do more creative work. You battle the resistance and get to work. Then, creativity becomes non-stop.
- **Become the best in the world at what you do.**
  - What is it you actually do?
  - Who are the people you help? What is the problem you're trying to solve for those people/ Don't define your audience or ideal customer by their demographics. Instead, define your audience by the problems they have.
  - How can you help this person? How can you help them so much that you become a hero to them?  How can you give so much to these people that you can change their lives for the better?
- **Invest heavily in yourself.**
  - You want to get in points of no return--it's like you are forced to move forward out of compulsion, but once you must go forward, you're not longer confused about what you need to do.
  - Psychological things to make sure you move forward:
    - You don't want to look like an idiot.
    - You want to justify your investment.
    - You have to be consistent with the behaviors you've performed.
    - You now have external conditions that will eventuate in a self-fulfilling prophecy.
- **Become a speaker and teach others what you've learned.**
  - Publicity, story, going in front of the world to share the message. You can manipulate human behavior, or you can inspire it.
  - People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it.
- **Learn in public, even when you're scared.**
  - Musicians, boxers, lion tamers all practice in public. There is a huge difference between abstract, theoretical knowledge and knowledge developed and tested in the crucible of experience.
  - If you want to learn something fast, learn in public. Learn through raw experience. Learn through failure. Surround yourself with a support system of people who love helping you and investing in you.
- **Take a few minutes every night to mentally prepare yourself for the next day.**
  - The success of your morning begins the night before.
  - Just a few minutes of thoughtful and affirmative meditation will put your subconscious on a path toward achieving your goals.

## Why Even Ambitious People Rarely Become Successful
[Reference](https://medium.com/personal-growth/why-even-ambitious-people-rarely-become-successful-937e7cf26bfe)

- "Success" occurs internally, because it's based on emotion. At its most basic level, success is your relationship with yourself.
- Much better than ambition is commitment. You do what is required for the attainment of that thing. You'll stop wondering and start building.
- Ex: marriage is different from non-marriage.
- "Become a millionaire not for the million dollars, but for what it will make of you to achieve it." Jim Rohn
- The truth: you're always changing. Your brain and biology are highly malleable. Your worldview is continually integrating new information. Your brain literally creates new connections and is reshaped. The brain you will have in a year from now will literally be a different brain than the one you have now.
- Instead of making it like a willpower thing, you just do it. Don't give yourself outs.
- Better to be committed than to be ambitious. In terms of the "authentic" self, it's the enemy. It's the excuse you have for not evolving.

- Useful models:
  - Socratic method: Ask why, why, why.,
  - Combinatory play: Combine existing parts of reality a la wheels + bag = luggage bag.
  - Bayes' Theorem. Using probabilistic thinking to estimate the likelihood of future events.
  - Design thinking: Understanding the needs of a person before working backwards to craft a solution.
  - First principles: Breaking things down to their fundamental truths and reasoning upwards from there.
- Ask good questions, strive to always learn, and develop a strong mental framework for evaluating the divergence between where you are and where you want to be.

## 5 Things I Had to Give Up To be Successful
[Reference](https://themission.co/5-things-i-had-to-give-up-to-be-successful-a7b076f3d859)

- There is an opportunity cost to everything worthwhile in life. Doctor: Give up your early 20s and 10 years of your life for school and training.
- Entrepreneur: Time, feeling of certainty/security that come with a steady paycheck.
- Athlete: Decades of training, deliberate practice.
- Kids: Ability to take risks, financial freedom.
- Traveling the world: Familiarity, friends, family, and a sense of belonging and community.
- Abs: Food they loved.

#### Other People's Definition of Success

- *Giving up other people's definition of success is incredibly liberating and ultimately leads to the fullest expression of who you are and what matters to you.* It's not a one-time thing. It's a daily habit of comparing less and creating more.
- Other people aren't going to live with the consequences of the choices you've made. So why would you live your life according to their definition of success?-

#### Financial Security

- I figured building a body of work would be far more valuable than to keep adding to my resume of failures.

#### Most of my 30s

- Read hundreds of books, wrote 3 books, planned a conference, produced an animated series, interviewed more than 600 people.
- Don't just increase your earnings, increase your earning potential.
- Time is the most valuable asset at your disposal.
- If you have one hour a day for uninterrupted creation time, you'll be amazed by what you're capable of.

#### Fear of Judgment

- It was embarrassing to still be living at home and not making much money.
- The fear of being judged keeps so many of us from taking a shot at our most ambitious dreams.
- The approval of people who won't consume my things is essentially meaningless.
- Once you give up your fear of judgment, your ability to work changes quite drastically. You focus on the process, not the prize, and you start to see progress towards the life you want to live.

#### Any Baggage Related to the Past

- The past can never be changed.
- "Just because someone screwed up your past, it doesn't mean you should give them permission to screw up your future."
- You have to sacrifice something that you value less than whatever it is you ultimately want.

  - Maybe you need your job for financial security, but in the meantime, you can choose to spend your free time differently. Invest in yourself. Create an outlet for your ideas and passion.
- Everyone has emotional garbage that is holding us back. If left unresolved, we can never experience a full sense of pride and self-love.
- Being an adult: resolving the garbage people have done to you.
- Successful self-care leads to healthy, growing pride in oneself.

  - Create income. Probably from several areas.

## This One Question Will Make Every Decision In Your Life Easier
[Reference](https://medium.com/personal-growth/this-1-powerful-strategy-made-the-british-rowing-team-to-go-from-average-to-winning-olympic-gold-b859b7f6cda1)

  - If you get invited to a late night party the night before training, will it make the boat go faster?
  - Will eating a donut make the boat go faster?
- Do you want to compete with someone who has this mindset, someone who is THIS deliberate about EVERY decision they make? Someone this thoughtful about their life, and how they respond to challenges?

# The Only Way To “Wake Up” And Become Unstoppable
[Reference](https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy/you-say-you-believe-failure-is-key-to-success-but-have-you-really-failed-8a9f88c4bdfd)

- ***“Would you like me to give you a formula for success? It’s quite simple, really. Double your rate of failure. You are thinking of failure as the enemy of success. But it isn’t at all. You can be discouraged by failure — or you can learn from it. So go ahead and make mistakes. Make all you can. Because, remember that’s where you will find success.” — Tom Watson, founder of IBM***
- Ex: 50 blog posts that don't get read, or pitching your business idea to 100 people to no avail, these are failures but these are not the type of failures we're thinking.
- We're thinking about "YOU MUST FIGURE SOMETHING OUT, OR ELSE, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN, AND YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW."
- These moments are where you're left without a choice. Your behavior literally must change or else, everything will crash down bad.
- ***You need to have one of those moments where you stop justifying time-wasters. Where you stop justifying playing small. Where you stop justifying spending time with the wrong people. Where you stop doing business with the wrong people. Where you stop being immature with your money and your relationships.***
- Where you get really serious about what you’re doing. And where you become hyper-committed to succeeding. Where you stop avoiding the mundane stuff you need to do.
- If you're not willing to lose everything you've gained, then you've lost the spirit that drove you on in the first place. You've over-attached yourself with the image that has become your reality.
- You can't just not avoid failure, and if you really want to grow in anything, you need to be true to yourself. If it's purely extrinsic, then it's shallow, and those around you will only care about what's external. YOU DO NOT WANT THAT.

## The Price of Growth and Success

- One of my favorite quotes: “Become a millionaire not for the million dollars, but for what it will make of you to achieve it.’”— Jim Rohn
- Mindset/Carol Dweck: Kids who framed their goals as "Learning Goals" were more focused on mastery and proactively sought out challenges.
- Kids who framed their goals as "Achievement Goals" avoid challenged and developed learned helplessness.
- Good mentoring involves creating scenarios where the learner can grow and must grow. Long-term failure isn't the goal. Growth is the goal.
- Why disadvantaged groups have an advantage:
  - Have a deep belief in self.
  - Feeling inferior and they must want to continually improve themselves.

# How To Know If You’ll Live Your Dreams
[Reference](https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy/heres-how-to-know-if-you-re-going-to-live-your-dreams-1ecf65b92e60)

- You must live in alignment with yourself, otherwise, you have no powerful, conviction, or clarity and you'll just be a clone of what others want you to be. No sense of being and no clear purpose in life. The only way to truly live congruently in life AND in your relationships is to be congruent with yourself.
- Whether you live out your dreams or not, life will be a struggle. Might as well be good? We control our actions, but the consequences that flow from those actions are controlled by principles.
- Let go of the need for a specific outcome: don't get derailed by success or defeat.

# How You Do Anything Is How You Do Everything
[Reference](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/how-you-do-anything-is-how-you-do-everything-bc6e264e40ee)

- President Andrew Johnson: Was a tailor before being a president, and was proud of his achievements as a tailor. "When I used to be a tailor, I had the reputation of being a good one, making close fits, always punctual with my customers, and always did good work."
- President James Garfield: He persuaded his school to let him be a janitor in exchange for tuition. Do your job and do it well.
- Andrew Carnegie: "The first jobs introduce us to the broom."
- ***Everything is a chance to do and be our best. Only self-absorbed assholes think they are too good for whatever their current station requires.***
- When action is our priority, vanity falls away.
- An artist is given many different canvases and commissions in their lifetime, and what matters is that they treat each one as a priority. Whether it’s the most glamorous or highest paying is irrelevant. Each project matters, and the only degrading part is giving less than one is capable of giving.
  - Some are prestigious, some are onerous, none are beneath us.
  - ***To whatever we face, our job is to respond with: hard work, honesty, and helping others as best we can.***
- Respect the craft and make something beautiful.

# Why We Hate Working for Big Companies
[Reference](https://medium.com/s/story/why-we-hate-working-for-big-companies-9e6c787a32ac)

- We have free markets, but a corporation is usually more like an authoritarian state.
- When hiring managers: author didn't want to be an employee, so why would others want to be an employee? There's also a problem when there's a separation between people doing the work and people who make the decisions.
- Free market: Central planning committees can never be as efficient or effective as people doing the work. (Markets do not have a manager to do this.)
- For things like China's Great Leap Forward, a commission telling the farmers what to produce leads to not-so-good decisions because there's a huge separation between the central planning committee and the farmer.
- ***The most important feature of free market economies is that each person within them is able to make independent decisions in their own best interest.***
- For much of history: people did as many things as they can (re: turning labor into a product).
- Corporations nowadays: when you reach a certain company size, you'll have a planning process, set out top-level goals, build plans, and get information from the front line to see where it needed tweaks.
  - What they need is to have a system where the people doing the work knew the organization's goals and plans.
  - Leadership is about making decisions.
  - The problem with a big company: the leadership is so far removed that it looks like a bureaucracy.
- ***I find it both ironic and painful that my inability to work for someone else resulted in my creating a company that involved a lot of smart, capable people working for someone else.***
  - How do you value most of the work people do?
  - Things end up with a concentration of wealth anyway.

- It's easier to steer a moving vehicle: when you're doing things, you can adjust on the fly.

- Life shrinks and expands in direct proportion to your willingness to assume risk: you need risks. The less risk you take, the less fulfilling your life will be at the end of it. When has the worst case scenario happened?
- If you're doing what everyone else is doing, you're probably doing it wrong.
- The straight line does not exist.
- If you want to get out of a rut, work.
- Free time is the enemy of progress. SPEND YOUR FREE TIME DELIBERATELY.

- ***Living for something beyond yourself: For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensure, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. - Viktor Frankl***
  - The Pygmalion effect: You as a person either rise or fall to the demands of your situation. If your situation doesn't demand much, you won't rise up.
  - Having other people depend on you is the pressure that turns you into a diamond. It will cause you to dig deep within yourself and overcome the addictions and bad habits holding you back.
  - It's not about the amount of hours you work, but the amount of thought and humanity you put into your work.

# The One Routine Common to Billionaires, Icons and World-Class Performers
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-one-routine-common-to-billionaires-icons-and-world-class-performers-28ed11a49eda)

- Of all the routines and habits, the most consistent among guests is some form of daily meditation or mindfulness practice. More than 80% of the world-class performers I interviewed shared this trait. Both can be thought of as “cultivating a present-state awareness that helps you to be nonreactive.”
  - *It is a “meta-skill” that improves everything else. You’re starting your day by practicing focus when it doesn't matter (sitting on a couch for 10 minutes) so that you can focus better later when it does matter (negotiation, conversation with a loved one, max deadlift, mind-melding with a Vulcan, etc.).*
- Exercise for the body: Two-handed kettlebell swing. Exercise for the mind: 10-20 minutes of meditation.
- Tim: 20 minutes, last 5 minutes is where the benefit is.
- The goal is not to "quiet the mind", the goal is to observe your thoughts.

# 19 Harsh Truths You Don’t Want To Hear But Must (You’ll Be 10 Times Better For It)

- ***We all have the same problems.*** Knowing your problems are all the same is how you stop yourself from getting stuck and feeling sorry for yourself.
- ***You don't need experience, ever.*** The line of "5 years of X skill required..." is just to stop time wasters and people that don't have the killer instinct to see past the obstacle laid out in front of them. You should not give up on your career dream just because of one line in one job add.
- ***Someone will die on us.*** The last thing you want is someone to die on you having the relationship tarnished because of something stupid like a disagreement over money or a difference in beliefs.
- ***Complaining is a fucking waste of time.***
- ***No one gives a fuck about your personal brand.*** If you deliver something of value, then we will all like your stuff.
- ***You never want to have regrets.*** When you realize that there are no barriers and you should try everything that your heart desires, you live a life of no regrets
- ***The human experience is full of suffering. Time to master it.*** Recognize that suffering is a necessity and learn to use it to your advantage. Suffering is part of the struggle which will help you do wonderful things in this world.
- ***Create value ahead of everything else.***
- ***Money won't make you happy.*** You chase feelings, not money. You don't want the money, you want the feeling that you get when you have it and buy stuff with it. Meaning and purpose give you better feelings and they are free.
- ***Be you and stop being an actor.*** You can always become the person you've dreamt of being. It takes discipline, courage, and a sense of fight to grow, adapt, and admit when you're wrong.
- ***The only currency is time.*** Quit trading time for money, distractions, toxic friends, bad habits, anything else you know is not serving what you stand for. Guard your time like you guard your life: protect your time and spend it on things that will cause you to help others, live without regrets, and be passionate.
- ***Execute.*** Execute is about not having all the answers and putting in the work.
- ***Trying to meet society's idea of success is a loser's game.*** Home ownership, cars, university: does this align with who we are? We know what our version of success is.
- ***We're going to die.***

- ***There is a paragraph, chapter, or book that would change your life forever if you read it.***
- Warren Buffett: The Intelligent Investor. Elon Musk: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Poor Charlie's Almanac.
- Quake books are worth a thousand merely good books.
- The Info-Apocalypse:
  - Content shock. Too much things to read!
  - Echo chambers. Cliques/polarization.
  - Constant distraction.
  - FOMO.
- The result: A daily diet of media junk food.
- The skill: figuring out how to access breakthrough knowledge. Change our approach to media from a reactive to a proactive one. Feeds are designed to keep our attention for as long as possible in the short-term and long-term.
- Finding the signal vs noise:
  - ***Does this information have the potential to change my life?*** Musk: It's very important to seek out and listen very carefully to negative feedback. This is something that people tend to avoid, because it's painful. I think that this is a very common mistake. *Evidence that proves your existing ideas wrong is more valuable than confirming evidence. Science grows by what is proven wrong, not what is proven right.*
  - ***Information overload is an age-old problem with age-old solutions.*** There are knowledge formats that have a higher value density: mental models have more density than book summaries than books than social media posts.
- ***Learn How to Learn.***
  - Understanding the scientific method.
  - Understanding the value of diverse knowledge (people who have "too many interests" are more likely to be successful according to research.
  - Understanding the cognitive biases (confirmation bias, backfire effect, Dunning-Kruger effect, halo effect, in-group bias).
- ***A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.***

- Are things done on ACTUAL work?
- Not more hours, less bullshit.
- On-demand is for movies, TV shows, and podcasts, not for you. Your time isn't an episode recalled when someone wants it at 10pm on a Saturday night.
- Calm company:
  - No growth-at-all-costs. No false busyness. No ego-driven decisions.
  - Money comes from the customers. Benefits: for the dudes.

# How To Achieve Your 10-Year Plan In The Next 6 Months
[Reference](https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-to-achieve-your-10-year-plan-in-the-next-6-months-f8c1cc54888e)

- 280 hours per month (after sleep, eating, and work). What are you doing then?
- *Reading books should stimulate new ways of thinking and acting in the world. If you're not acting differently, you're not actually learning, and thus not changing.*
- *For most people, learning has become an escape from doing. Filling your head with useless information is the opposite of hard-won wisdom and understanding, which can only happen via the application of knowledge and re-application based on experience in the real world.*
- When you awaken, you:
  - Acknowledge to yourself that you have a problem.
  - Seek out information and help.
  - Get accountability.
  - Create an environment that facilitates your desire to change.
  - Being investing in more healthy alternatives.
- Audit your time.
  - Begin tracking everything!
  - Today's environment: trigger-laden. It's easy to be distracted by technology and get distracted that it's hard for us to imagine being fully AWAKE and present for long periods of time.
  - You absolutely cannot achieve things 10x or 20x faster if you're distracted on social media, because it's a very low-level use of time.
  - Recovering and resting and playing for several hours per day is great, it's stimulating and fulfilling and leads to growth and deepening of self and relationships.

## What if You Only Had 6 Months Left to Live?

- To value your time:
  - A belief system about the purpose of your existence.
  - A belief about how you should be using your time.
  - A desire to live and learn.
  - A disregard for how (most) people perceive you.
  - A willingness to continue learning.
  - A goal you're striving to accomplish.
- *This is a fundamental irony of most people’s lives. They don’t quite know what they want to do with their lives. Yet they are very active.*
- Few people are clear on:
  - What they believe.
  - What they should do because of that belief.
  - How to most effectively accomplish that belief.
- Then:
  - Get really, really good at learning and filtering through information.
  - Give yourself a short time-line.
  - Use your most important time, every single day, for moving toward your goals.
  - Remove everything from your life that hinders you from achieving your goals.
- If you don't focus...
  - Most people don't see a reason to eat healthy.
  - Most people don't see a reason to evaluate the quality of everything they put in their mouth and in their heads.
  - When you know your time is limited, you begin to ask harder questions.
  - *If you had 6 months to live, how much of that time would you spend on Facebook? If you had 6 months left to live, would it be difficult to wake up at 5AM?*
  - Honesty, brutal honesty. That's the difference.

## Pulling It All Together

- You must have something that drives you.
- You must operate with a "deathbed" mentality and not undervalue your time.
- Be willing to experiment and fail continually.
- You can't be a coward.
- *Be an intense and wise learner. The best information from the best resources and apply immediately what you learn.*
- You need to reach out to the right people quicker. You need to put your work out there and face an audience immediately. If you start doing all of these things, you'll get feedback. And that's what failure is: failure is feedback.
- The harsher and more honest and more direct the feedback, the better. Use that feedback. Adjust. Get better information. It's an absolutely amazing feeling to be living your life as if you only had 6 months left to live.
- ***Stop dealing with stuff that no longer makes sense.*** You'll act with far more purpose, persistence, and boldness.
- If you want more confidence, start striving toward the life you want. Even if you fail, you'll be proud of yourself. And if you're committed, you'll begin to succeed. You'll eventually get so much momentum that it becomes your new normal to operate at optimal levels.

# 13 Things You Should Give Up If You Want To Be Successful
[Reference](https://medium.com/@zdravko/13-things-you-should-give-up-if-you-want-to-be-successful-1ecb7d62e558)

- The unhealthy lifestyle.
- The short-term mindset. It's not "working out to get a summer body", it's "working out because that's who you are."
- Playing small. Voice your ideas, don't be afraid to fail, and certainly don't be afraid to succeed.
- Your excuses. Can't do anything about the starting point, weaknesses, and past failures. The only way you can become successful is when you realize that YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN YOUR LIFE.
- Fixed mindset. Growth mindset, acquire new knowledge, learn new skills, change their perceptions.
- "The Magic Bullet." Just improve 1% per day.
- Perfectionism.
- Multi-tasking. Being fully present and committed to one task.
- The need to control everything.
- Saying YES to things that don't support your goals. To achieve much, you need to sacrifice much.
- The toxic people. Negative people have a problem for every solution. Be with people who refuse to take responsibility for your life, those who always find excuses and blame others for the situation they are in. Be around people who are always trying to increase your standard of living and are trying to grow personally and professionally.
- The need to be liked.
- Wasting time.

## Comments

- ***I believe when people leave school that they make one of two choices: they choose to spend their life learning or being entertained. Few choose the former, I'd say it’s around 10–20%. The vast majority choose a life of being entertained. They do not read or don’t read much. What they do read is light entertainment. They watch a lot of TV. They closely follow their local sports teams and plan their vacations and weekends around being entertained.***
  - Few focus on reading good books, challenging podcasts and thoughtful "success" articles. In other words, improving themselves. Very few men that I've known in the business world are well read. For some reason, far more women read. Few work on the things outlined in this article. They simply get a job and most are unhappy in their work.
  - They just don't see themselves as ever being able to live the life of their dreams, of being so successful that they will have financial independence and be able to make significant contributions in helping others.
- *Life in essence is a great test. How much time am I willing to spend improving myself, prepping for the future? Most probably spend less than 20% prepping and 80% experiencing (being entertained).* Their friends do the same. But IMO the winners reverse those numbers: they spend most of their time prepping, learning, reading, thinking. These few spend time with people who think similarly. They look to be mentored by successful leaders. And, over time, they can achieve success and help others on a scale that others never thought was possible for themselves.
- I lost a lot of similar aged friends, mainly women, because they made me feel guilty for my success, I had to explain, justify even defend my “lucky and fortunate” life. At first I felt bad for all my “luck” but then I quickly realized I am the one doing all the hard work. It’s not my fault that others don’t get their asses up — excuse my language — I am still grateful for my life and privileges BUT I don’t owe it to anyone except my own willpower and strength. That’s when I gradually withdrew from outgrown relationships that made me feel bad instead of great! And surprisingly I built new friendships that truly nurture and support me.

# The Crucial Thinking Skill Nobody Ever Taught You
[Reference](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-crucial-thinking-skill-nobody-ever-taught-you-536191d101ab)

- Inversion: thinking of the worst possible thing that can happen to you. One of the best ways to clarify your thinking was to restate math problems in an inverse form. Write down the opposite of the problem you're trying to solve.
- Charlie Munger: You want to avoid sloth and unreliability. Be proactive and reliable.
- "What would someone do each day if they were a terrible manager?" Avoid those things.
- "How could we make this company less innovative?" Don't do those things.
- Think of how you can kill the company, and don't do the things that would let you do those.
- We should be choosing what we want to keep, not what we want to get rid of.

# How to influence company culture
[Reference](https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-to-influence-culture-7b53e360b53f)

- You can't manipulate someone else's basic underlying assumptions, because each person has their own intrinsic, worthwhile desires and beliefs.
- What you can do is to focus on creating an environment where employees can choose to shift their basic underlying assumptions in line with what feels right to them.
- ***Personal accountability. As the leader, you should be the living embodiment of the basic underlying assumptions you want your culture to have. You should be consciously and intentionally speaking and acting in a way that shows people, “This is important to me.”***
- ***Consistency.*** If you want to have all-hands meetings to discuss company goals, etc., you need to have it every month. Make sure those things are consistent.
- ***Richness.*** All-hands meetings are cool, but you also need other channels. One-on-ones, coffees, group lunches, surveys. Different ways of communicating means that the culture becomes foundational.

# How to Reverse Aging and Become Whoever You Want to Be
[Reference](https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-to-literally-anti-age-and-become-whoever-you-want-to-be-ffdd8ebf379f)

- Triggering your bodies mentally to exhibit the energy and biological responses of much younger persons.
- After five days, improvement in hearing, eyesight, memory, dexterity, appetite.
- *By expecting men to function independently as individuals, rather than as "old people", Langer gave these men an opportunity to see themselves differently, which affected them biologically.*
- The roles you play in life determine your identity and behavior.
- You can either play the role of a musician, a parent, a friend, a lover, a student, or a teacher.
- Allow yourself to evolve based on the role you are in. Quit putting yourself in a box.
- You are the author of your life's narrative. You have the power to determine the stages of life on which you will perform, and the characters you will play.
- You need to know what you want to do with your life. Don't just react to things (scrolling through the news feed, landing on the random pages that appear). When you decide on what you want, the universe conspires to make it happen.
- *Every next level of your life will demand a different you.*
- Being mindful: Who we are at any one time depends mostly on the context in which we find ourselves. But who creates the context? The more mindful we are, the more we can create the contexts we are in. When we create the context, we are more likely to be authentic.
- Commitment over willpower. If you're in an environment that organically generates your goals, you're forced to become more than you currently are.
- In every situation and human interaction you're in, you're performing. How do you want to influence those around you? Who do you need to be to achieve your goals? What will your voice be? What is your role?
- Act as if. When you're stretched, it's not pretty. But over time, you'll adapt to your environment. You'll come to play your role so naturally that you'll no longer be acting. Acting AS IF will become acting AS IS. You will become who you intended to be, which is your most authentic self.
- The real path to success in work and life is through creating an inner circle of lifeline relationships. These are deep, close relationships with a few trusted individuals who will offer the encouragement, feedback, and generous mutual support you need to reach your full potential.
- When I get the craving to buy something stupid, I don't get the negative feeling that I'm not getting what I want. Instead, I get a positive feeling that I'm taking control of my financial life.

# First, care.
[Reference](http://www.43folders.com/2010/02/05/first-care)

- Before you sweat the logistics of focus: first, care. Care intensely. If you can't focus on one thing at a time, maybe you're just thinking of too many things.
- How many things do I need to not care about in order to focus on this thing that I love?
- You "focus" on the one thing you care about, as you "unfocus" on everything else.

# Resilience: How to Rescue Yourself from Adversity
[Reference](https://medium.com/personal-growth/resilience-how-to-rescue-yourself-from-adversity-d8108dbe1fb3)

- To overcome adversity, you must rescue yourself first. Your mindset, not the event, defines if you will be "rescued" or not.
- Many scuba divers in accidents were found dead with air in their lungs and perfectly functioning regulators. There is an impulse to remove your mask when you're drowning, you just have to focus on the here and now and what you need to do.
- The damage model: because people are born in a troubled family, their fate will be doomed too.
- Resilient children are "luck" enough to have a strong bond with a supportive caregiver, teacher, or other mentor figures. More importantly, they behave autonomously and independently and met the world on their own terms.
- You can learn to rescue yourself from adversity: how you engage with reality determines your fate. An even is not traumatic unless we experience it as such.
- Resilience: about how you adapt to things.
  - Optimism + creativity + confidence.
  - Challenge: turn difficulty into a challenge.
  - Commitment: have something to fight for: a mission bigger than yourself, your relationships or spiritual beliefs.
  - Self-control: you can't manage reality, but you can control your emotions and reactions.
- Preparing:
  - Reframe your thoughts about reality. You can't control reality, but you can manage how you adapt to it.
  - Prepare for the worst: expose yourself to frequent rejections. How you overcome rejections in the present determines how you will deal with stressors in the future. Practice creating discomfort in everyday routines.
  - Create alternative paths. Playful humor. "The person who toys with the situation creates an inner feeling of "this is my plaything; I am bigger than it. I won't let it scare me."
  - Relationships
  - Spiritual activities. Acts of kindness.

# The Purpose Of Life Is Not Happiness: It’s Usefulness
[Reference](https://medium.com/darius-foroux/the-purpose-of-life-is-not-happiness-its-usefulness-65064d0cdd59)

- Chasing happiness: buying things, hooking up, getting a well-paying job you don't like, going on holiday, and thinking those make you happy.
- How do you achieve happiness? Happiness can't be a goal in itself. So it's not something that's achievable.
- Most of the things we do in life are activities and experiences: holiday, work, shopping, drinks, buying dinner and cars. Those things are not useful by themselves. Holiday and shopping is nice, but it doesn't give meaning to life.
- What are you doing that's making a difference?
  - Helping your boss, spending time with family, writing articles, building things, starting businesses.
  - Try to be useful. Don't overthink it, just do it.

# How Facebook Has Flattened Human Communication

- It's vastly easier for a computer to make sense out of a "like" or a five star rating than to parse meaning out of raw text. Star ratings allow sorting, filtering, and historical analysis over time.
- **"The First Law of Internet Data: In any computational context, explicitly structured data floats to the top."**
  - Explicitly structured: data that has categories, quantification, rankings. This is easier for algorithms to handle rather than unstructured data like text in human language, images, and video.
  - Early Internet is the beginning of a process of explicit quantification of things. Web 2.0: the classification of the social and more generally the classification of life.
- **The Second Law of Internet Data: For any data set, the classification is more important than what's being classified.**
  - The conclusions and impact of data analyses flow from the classifications under which the data has been gathered, rather than from the data itself. When FB groups people together in some category, what really matters is that a category exists, rather than finding out how the category was derived (usually, this criteria is arbitrary or even wrong).
- **The Third Law of Internet Data: Simpler classifications will tend to defeat more elaborate classifications.**
  - Internet services can deal with complicated classifications, but business and technical inertia prefer simpler ones.
  - Facebook: Prefers to figure out what people want, rather than what people don't want. So it prefers things like `Like` and `Haha`, rather than `Angry` and `Sad`. Facebook splits "positive" into "Haha", "Love", "Wow", and negative into just "Sad" or "Angry".
  - Buzzfeed: it's schemes are surprising/adorable/shocking/funny. These are good for market research, because it then shows like "is content surprising, adorable, shocking, funny", etc.
  - This can enable a more sophisticated analyses than a more complicated schema - it's easier to figure out how a person felt with an emoji, rather than a "LOL" or a "great".
  - There is also little to no variation in reaction choices across different countries, languages, and cultures.
  - These sentiments also make it easy to compare posts quantitatively: because you can sort articles according to the reaction, FB can figure out commonality. Ex: "do I show this article to the users, given that this article has been tagged as 'funny' or 'heartwarming' by other people?", or "do I show this article to other users, given that the person who shared this is a grumpy person?"
  - When they tried testing with a far larger set of emotions, the simple classification won out. It's both easier to use and more universal, at the expense of cultural and personal variation.
  - Wut → "Countries that expressed the most "happiness" were not actually the happiest in real life, instead, it was the countries that used the widest array of stickers that did better on various measures of societal health and well-being".
- At around 2015, there was less discussion happening on Facebook walls, reactions became simple Emojis and simple reactions.

# Why We Are Feeling Lonelier Than Ever
[Reference](https://medium.com/personal-growth/why-we-are-feeling-lonelier-than-ever-ffdb9083b2c4)

- Dostoevsky: A theme in his novels is about how individuals deal with themselves when they have done something of consequence. (Guilt, loneliness, isolation).
- How does the mind make sense of ideas of belonging, connection, and meaning.
- *"Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others."*
- "loneliness" the concept popped up in the 16th century.
- We live in a world of increasing cultural complexity. People were fairly similar back in villages. Now, diversity.
- Everyone was formed differently, and that means it's hard to find people who think and understand like us.
- Whenever a character deals with committing a crime or with knowingly causing suffering, it's never the outer reality that punishes them, it's their own psyche.
- The realization that someone can never be fully be honest with someone else makes them feel alone and isolated.
- Online: you are different person at home than at work, online than offline, in one subculture vs another one.
- Due to various social norms, we have to hide some parts of ourselves in front of certain people and in certain places. These lies begin to build on top of each other.
- *True connection: showing your whole self, as they show theirs, simply accepting that not everyone is going to relate to it.*
- The irony: it takes a lot of isolation and solitude to develop the self-awareness to see that all of this is playing out beneath the surface.
- Instead of managing your image, you are forced to reckon with the person behind the appearances: the lies you tell both yourself and other people, the shame you feel, and everything else that your mind hides from you.
- Real honesty and a lasting connection require the participation of two reciprocating parties willing to bare themselves, which isn't up to you, but it has to start with how you relate to yourself.
- *Any time a character gives in to the guilt of their falsehoods and remove the psychological burden that weights down their life, they find themselves feeling freer than they had been before, even if they are punished for their confessions later on.*
- "Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood."
- Limiting our life to those who care and those who value our relationship could minimize the pain of reconciling multiple identities.

# 20 signs your personality is so unique it intimidates others
[Reference](https://hackspirit.com/10-signs-personality-unique-intimidating-others/)

- You stick to your word. This makes others look bad because most people slack off in certain areas of their life.
- You are candid. You say what you mean and mean what you say. Telling it like it is doesn't always sit well with others.
- You keep an open mind.
- You solve problems, rather than sitting around feeling sorry for yourself.
- You are stubborn and strong-willed. You don't take no for an answer, and if you believe there is an answer to be found, you will find it, no matter what.
- You loathe complainers. You know that taking life by the horns can be intimidating for some people who are afraid of what might happen if they took the leap of faith.
- You don't support ignorance. You do not tolerate people who are ignorant. Willful ignorance is the worst. If you know better, but choose to believe something worse without questioning it, well that just solidifies their own stupidity. You don't have time for that, and it makes you the outcast sometimes.
- You know your stuff. You can talk to people from all walks of life and can carry on a conversation even if it's over your head because you listen to what people are saying. There's a lot of folks who won't like that about you, but that's their problem.
- You think small talk is a bore. Your go-getter attitude moves you up the ladder in life, but many people won't like that you work so hard.
- You can be kind. When you can get stuff done and you are a nice person, damn. You know what's important and what you think of yourself and where you are going. And even if you might be upsetting a few people along your way, you don't really care. Your strong personality allows you to live the life you want without regret.
- There's always more to learn.
- You're selfless and love to make others happy. You know that you're not the center of the universe and you aim to make anyone that crosses your path happy.
- You're optimistic. There's no point harboring a negative attitude in life. That doesn't help you achieve anything.
- You've got goals and dreams to achieve. You're ambitious, motivated, and operate from a power of working towards something higher than yourself. For you, life is about taking action, and that can intimidate people who are insecure about what they're achieving in life.
- You love to get out of your comfort zone, and some other people can't handle it and prefer to remain secure in their small little box.
- You believe that fear is an opportunity to grow and experience something new. If you're not experiencing fear, then you're not living right.
- You don't waste time gossiping.
- You're careful about who you let into your life.
- You don't need superficial attention.

# The Discomfort You're Feeling is Fear
[Reference](https://hbr.org/2020/03/that-discomfort-youre-feeling-is-grief)

- We feel the world has changed, we know this is temporary, but it doesn't feel that way. Things will change and this is the point at which they changed. The loss of normalcy, the fear of economic toll, the loss of connection. Collectively, we are grieving. We are not used to this kind of collective grief in the air.
- Anticipatory grief - the feeling we get about what the future holds when we're uncertain. The same thing as when you get news about someone who gets a bad diagnosis. With this virus, this kind of grief is confusing, because our primitive mind knows something bad is happening, but you can't see it, and this breaks our sense of safety. We're feeling that loss of safety.
- To manage the grief - the stages are not linear.
  - Denial: "The virus won't affect us."
  - Anger: "You're making me stay at home and taking away my activities."
  - Bargaining: "Okay, if I social distance for two weeks, everything will be better, right?"
  - Sadness: "I don't know when this will end."
  - Acceptance: "This is happening, I have to figure out how to proceed.
- Unhealthy anticipatory grief is really anxiety, and that's the feeling you're talking about. We think about the worst scenarios. Our goal is not to ignore those thoughts, but to find balance in the things you're thinking. If you feel the worst image taking shape, make yourself think of the best image.
- To calm yourself, you want to come into the present. Just think that nothing you've anticipated has happened. Right now, you're okay. You have food. You are not sick.
- Let go of what you can't control. You cannot control your neighbor. What you can control is to stay far from your neighbor and wash your hands.
- Stock up on compassion - everyone will have different levels of fear and grief and it manifests in different ways. Think: "that's not like this person, that's how they're dealing with this. I'm seeing their fear and anxiety."
- Historically, this is survivable. The sixth stage of grief: acceptance. We can connect through technology. We can use our phones for long conversations. We are appreciating walks. I believe we will continue to find meaning now and when this is over.
- Emotions are emotions. Let yourself be sad. Your work is to feel your sadness and fear and anger whether or not someone else is feeling something. Fighting it doesn't help because your body is producing the feeling. If we allow the feelings to happen, they'll happen in an orderly way, and it empowers us. Then, we're not victims.

# Friedrich Nietzsche: Why Life Isn't Meaningless
[Reference](https://medium.com/@ztrana/friedrich-nietzsche-why-life-isnt-meaningless-44ab0fb53a85)

- Nietzsche's real concern: finding meaning in a world that was seeing a trending decline in religion.
- Evolutionary theory suggests that life is nothing more than survival and genetic endurance. Many religions lean towards a belief system that prefers the idea of heaven as a destination.
- Psychotherapy:
  - Will to pleasure: Freud.
  - Will to meaning: Frankl.
  - Will to power: Nietzsche. Mastery over oneself and the environment. This is what dictates our behaviour, and to live meaningfully is to align this will to power with actions and intentions.
- Increasing power over yourself can be about controlling emotions. Increasing power over the environment may be about opportunity and optionality. An increase in power over others is more often a product of kindness than it is violence.
- Ubermensch: The ideal end for people to strive towards, and to get there, we would have to overcome and master our current self.
  - ***In a world losing its connection to God and religion, he saw a need for us to create our own values to live meaningfully. But to do that, we would first need to envision a better and more advanced being than our current selves as to give us a significant aim.***
  - There is an image that is worth striving. An image that motivates the values we hold and the context in which we frame our will to power. The idea of self-overcoming is less about a sudden change than it is about an ongoing personal transformation. The point is to give the journey of evolution a form of meaning.
- Pain demands an action, but it doesn't always just go away.
- Nietzsche: The only problem with suffering is that we automatically label it as bad. We see it as something to avoid even though the rational function of pain is to make us stronger.

# How to Avoid a Life of Misery
[Reference](https://medium.com/personal-growth/how-to-avoid-a-life-of-misery-4c9cf2ab9ca9)

- Core idea of stoicism: be aware of what you can and what you can't control. Once you have that awareness, you can avoid misery by changing what you can control and letting go of what you can't.
- Internal locus of control: Change what you can control. Let go of what you can't control.
- ***Everything in life is your responsibility, and every negative occurrence is bad because of how you dealt with it, not what happened. You should expect to be treated unfairly, you should know that things will be hard, and you should be ready for stress and pain.***
- With this state of mind, there is no excuse, even if it is valid, because you accept full responsibility, and you begin to associate the annoyances of life with your own inability to deal with them.
- While a lack of focus is never going to help you establish a sense of mastery in any single domain, it's important to balance the meaning you derive from your work with other things in your life, like hobbies and personal projects.
- Identity - associating it with a single thing poses too great of a risk on the occasion that you get detached from that thing. You should never rely on a single thing to bring you fulfillment.

# The Shy Person’s Guide to Starting Conversations with Strangers
[Reference](https://michael-thompson.medium.com/the-shy-persons-guide-to-starting-conversations-with-strangers-ea67f506c439)

- Begin by identifying the people who look open to talking with you, or simply practice on people who are literally paid to talk to you.
- Let people know you won't be taking up much of their time.
- Cheat by reaching out to people you already know online. Thanks to social media, it's easy to find a few talking points and learn what someone's been up to.
- Charm people with your ears. They make you feel seen by listening to you and asking thoughtful follow-up questions.

# How to make friends as an adult
[Reference](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-make-new-friends-when-youre-busy-with-adulthood)

- A defining feature of friendship is that it's voluntary. We're not wedded together by law, or through blood, or via monthly payments. It is a relationship of great freedom, one that we retain only because we want to.
- People in a romantic relationship had on average two fewer close social ties, including friends. With kids, more. We have other priorities, ones that aren't quite as voluntary.
- Friends are not only a great source of fun and meaning in life, but without them, we're at a greater risk of feeling more depressed. *A key difference between the most unhappy and the most happy people were how socially connected they were.*
- Making more friends in adulthood takes some deliberate effort. Overt avoidance - not putting yourself in situations where it's possible to meet new people. Covert avoidance - showing up but not engaging people.
- Forms of avoidance are caused by understandable fears of rejection. Believe that other people will love you and find you interesting, and you will share more about yourself, disagree less, and have a more positive attitude. If you go into social situations with a positive mindset, then it's more likely that this will actually turn out to be the case.
- ***On average, strangers like us more than we realise.*** Go into new social events assuming that people will like you. This can keep us from being paralysed by fears of rejection, pushing us to question some of these fears. Try working on your internal dialogue, your inner voice that perhaps makes overly negative assumptions about how people will respond to you.
- Set aside time to reach out to people regularly, revitalise old relationships and awaken new ones, check in, find time to hang out. Initiative can change the course of our friendships.
- ***To embrace the importance of initiating, you mus let go of the myth that friendship happens organically. You have to take responsibility rather than waiting passively.***
- Initiating is very important for people who find themselves in new social settings - people who have moved to a new city, started a new school or job.
- Friendships thrive when we have continuous interaction. My problem with sustaining connection was that I lacked the opportunity for repeated encounters. Going to a lecture, happy hour, or networking event afforded me only one opportunity to connect. If you can, it's a better idea to sign up for activities that give you multiple opportunities to connect (language class, writing course, club).
- Mere exposure effect: the tendency to  like things the more familiar they seem. At an unconscious level, even if someone never talks to you, being familiar with them increases likability. We're primed to like people more if we know that we'll see them again.
- If you want to make friends, you should commit to showing up somewhere for a few months. If you go to one event, feel uncomfortable and don't return, you're selling yourself short. If you persist, you'll feel more comfortable, get to know people more, and they'll come to like you more as time goes on.
- Get vulnerable: A coworker can become a true friend - admitting some struggles at work can draw you closer. Vulnerability can deepen connections. Acquaintance = someone you know of, friend is someone you know.
  - To make true friends, you have to share things about yourself and ask people questions, so that they share about themselves too.
  - What your passions are, what you spend your free time on, what you're looking forward to. The more they share about themselves, the more they end up liking each other.
- The secret to making friends as an adult is that you have to try. You have to put yourself out there, ask people to meet up, show up at events, and keep doing it.

# Accept The Awkwardness: How To Make Friends (And Keep Them)
[Reference](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/15/751479810/make-new-friends-and-keep-the-old)

- Accept the awkwardness and assume that other people need new friends, too. You cannot have friends without getting vulnerable.
- People like you more than you think they will. Do things you're passionate about and you will naturally draw people to you, and you'll naturally connect with other people because you'll be in the right place.
- Treat friendship as seriously as you would dating.
- Be present - listen and notice things about your friend, take notes, and remember the names of folks in your friends' lives.

# Gifts
[Reference](https://www.willpatrick.co.uk/articles/how-to-buy-gifts-that-people-actually-want)
[Reference](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25267847)

- Gift-givers: surprise, desirability, price tag, social responsibility.
- Gift-receivers: is it useful, can I do things with it, is it made well, did I actually say I want this.
- ***We focus too much on the moment of exchange.***
- We like to be given experiences, but we don't like to gift them. Research shows that an "experience" gift is often preferred instead of the usual variety of material gifts that get doled out every year.
- Don't care too much about the price.
- Consumables are fine.
- Ask about what we would want, usually that is what they would probably want, too.
- Keep a note for what people say that they wanted to buy. Also, you have to know the person a bit to know why they didn't get the gift for themselves already.

# 5 Life Lessons From Therapists Who Have Been Listening to People’s Problems For Decades
[Reference](https://medium.com/personal-growth/5-life-lessons-from-psychotherapists-who-have-been-listening-to-peoples-problems-for-decades-b3265f081571)

- The preciousness of time - live each day without a sense of entitlement, treating it as a precious gift. Wake up each day and realise that you have today to live your life to the fullest.
- Your own goals are far more important than anyone else's - people are motivated by what excites them, scares them, what they dream about, etc. People can be motivated in the short term by what other people want for them, but this is rarely powerful enough to help motivate them to make better choices when they find themselves in difficult situations. What's your reason for getting up in the morning? Losing your sense of purpose or reason to be excited about life can have a detrimental effect.
- What you can accomplish in life is limited by the stories you tell yourself.
  - Anxious people - have a tendency to only explore the scary "what ifs". There's no obstacle that cannot be reframed into an opportunity.
  - What we can accomplish is limited by the stories we've been told about ourselves, becoming our internal narrative and sense of identity.
- Worry is not only futile but it also robs you of the present
  - To overcome worrying, shift your worry from the long-term problems to daily routines/actions that will solve the problems. Easiest is to write your worries down. Life it too short to waste it by worrying about events you can't control.
- When your emotions are under control, you can consciously put yourself in the best state that gets you in a position, and in a situation, where you can make better decisions.
  - 60 seconds rule: Just wait 60 seconds before doing anything to get better control of our emotions. When you're mad, just wait.

# 7 Signs of Low Self-Esteem
[Reference](https://medium.com/personal-growth/7-signs-of-low-self-esteem-d394fbaf2e45)

- You define yourself by your past. How you feel about yourself is not always a good indicator of your true value. They don't over-prioritize their past selves at the expense of their future selves. When you define yourself by your past, you give away control over your future.
- Your procrastinate on your passions. People with healthy self-esteem trust themselves to pursue their passions even if it means failure, mistakes, or frustrations. They've built up the confidence to go after the things that matter most to them despite the possibility of failure, embarrassment, or mistakes.
- Being hypercritical of others. They criticise others as a way to make themselves look better in comparison. When you criticise someone's opinion for being stupid, you're implying that you're smart, and that feels good. When I criticise other people, am I trying to be genuinely helpful or am I trying to make myself feel better?
- Setting healthy boundaries - when you reinforce a healthy boundary, you reinforce the belief that you matter just as much as anyone else.
- Indecisiveness in small decisions - the result of low confidence in your own ability to make decisions. People make bad decisions, and in the end, that's okay.
- You rely on other people to feel better.
- Struggling to take compliments - a compliment accepted is a vote of confidence in yourself.

# 7 Ways to Build High Self-Esteem
[Reference](https://nickwignall.com/high-self-esteem/)

- Make time to clarify your values. Ultimately, high self-esteem comes from living your life in a way that aligns with your values. If you habitually compromise on your values in the way you think and act, you're setting yourself up for low self-esteem, poor self-worth, and low confidence.
  - When you follow through on going to the gym, you train your own brain to believe that you are trustworthy and reliable, the kind of person who does what they say they will.
  - If your values aren't clear and compelling, and you don't know what matters most to you, then you would not follow through on your best intentions and commitments to yourself. Values mean things like honesty, integrity all the way down to things like maintaining physical health, spending quality time with good friends.
  - To clarify your values, thing of the things in life that are important to you. For each of these values ,try to be as specific as you can in describing what and why something is important. Sticking to the habit - knowing your values means a habit of reflecting on them regularly. Once you know your values, high self-esteem will not be far behind.
- Shift your focus from outcomes to growth.
  - Even though they may have very specific goals and outcomes they would like to achieve, they don't spend much time and energy thinking about them. Instead, they keep their focus on the process of growth. As long as you spend your time and energy on routine and actions that will move you towards there, it becomes more likely that you reach that goal, and your self-esteem will also grow along the way.
- Eliminate negative self-talk
  - How we habitually talk to ourselves determines how we habitually feel about ourselves. By changing our self-talk to be just a little less negative, we can achieve higher self-esteem.
- Cultivate a habit of gratitude
  - People who consistently acknowledge and express their gratitude seem to have fairly high self-esteem.
  - Some people have small habits and routines of gratitude so that being grateful is just a part of their lives.
- Manage your expectations effectively.
- Spend more time with the right people.
  - If people around you are cruel, sarcastic, condescending, cold, judgmental, manipulative, your idea of low self-esteem gets perpetuated.
  - If your key relationships are supportive, encouraging, loving, kind, compassionate, and honest, high self-esteem is likely.
  - Simply making tough decisions to change the type of people you let into your life is key to generating high self-esteem. When your actions are in conflict with your values, your self-esteem is going to suffer.
- Learn to be assertive.
  - Not passive communication (holding back on expressing what you want in order to appease others)

# Why Emotion Management Is the Key to Long-Term Productivity
[Reference](https://nickwignall.com/emotion-management/)

- Emotional management: how you react when you get hit with strong emotions.
  - How do you handle a sudden spike in anxiety?
  - What's your go-to strategy when you're feeling down and depressed?
  - Which automatic thoughts pop into mind when you get criticised?
- Monkey mind:
  - Automatic self-talk is "that doesn't quite work" with a tinge of disappointment.
  - Self-talk, negative emotion, the mind trying to distract itself. Acknowledge to yourself what you don't feel good about, remind yourself that it's okay and normal to feel anxious and discouraged, then put my fingers back on the keyboard and keep at it.
- ***Mindfulness or a lack of self-awareness is always the Enemy Number 1.*** If you're not vigilant, it's likely that your emotions will get the best of you. If you can stay mindful of your own mind and emotions during challenging tasks, you'll have a better chance of managing whatever gets thrown at you and staying on track with your work.
- ***The mind will always resist challenging work. It doesn't mean something's wrong.*** The mind will try to conserve mental and physical energy.
- By procrastinating, I was getting quick relief from the uncomfortable emotion generated by my critical and skeptical self-talk.
- Procrastination is a form of impatience that says if you're not succeeding right away, that means it's hopeless.
- I tend to procrastinate and struggle to do my work when I’m not paying attention to my own mind and mindlessly reactive to the thoughts and emotions it generates. On the other hand, when I remind myself to stay aware of my own mind and manage my emotions well, productivity struggles like procrastination still come up, but they are far less potent and easier to navigate successfully.

# How to think clearly
[Reference](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-think-clearly-to-improve-understanding-and-communication)

- Reddit Explain Like I'm Five.
- Clarifying your thinking: admit your thoughts are unclear to begin with, and then certain elements within them need to be rethought, or placed on more secure foundations.
- Clarifying is iterative: you're aiming at a process, the result of which will always be an act of communication, complete with all the imperfections and contingencies this implies.
- Pausing: Can question existing ways of acting. Without pauses, there can be no second thoughts and no self-interrogations. There is no process until you take the time to embark upon it.
- What are you claiming, and why?
  - Philosophy - what's know as standard form is used to set out the essentials of a line of thought as clearly as possible.
  - Expressing your thinking in standard form means writing out a numbered list of statements followed by a conclusion.
  - Ex: veganism - yes, all the points are true, but I just don't find them compelling enough.
- To clarify my thinking around this issue, I need to investigate the divide between my apparent beliefs and my actions.
  - Stripping away oversimplifications and replacing them with an honest acknowledgment of circumstances.
  - The logic of my initial argument might have seemed admirably clear; but this clarity doesn't correspond as closely as I might wish to reality.
- What am I taking for granted?
  - Whatever we don't explicitly spell out, but that your thinking relies upon.
  - When it comes to thinking, you have to be very clear about the difference between what follows from your assumptions and the status of those assumptions.
  - One of the most useful things you can thus do is to spell out both your own and other people's key assumptions, then to compare what follows from each.
- Clearly presenting the thinking:
  - Justify your position via evidence and reasoned analysis.
  - Accept that in the face of sufficiently compelling arguments or evidence, it might be reasonable to change your mind.

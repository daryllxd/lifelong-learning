## Lesson 1

Affordances = features: Right size, can be flipped, can be thrown, and you can hide behind it because it doesn't afford the transmission of light.

Conceptual Model: "There's something inside it because it makes a noise when I shake it.

Signifier: A tab thing that tells me to open it.

Tim Brown: Being a designer doesn't just help me with my projects, it helps me with my life. I have to design experiences for things such as a party. I think design thinking is a set of tools that helps you approach problems differently. We're taught in school methods of solving a problem, but there is a different way of solving problems in Design Thinking. It starts with thinking hard, looking hard, listening hard, and trying to understand people, what their issues might be, what they are thinking, and using that as a starting point for ideas.

"Don't solve the problem, but figure out what the problem, or the question is." Creative is about solving the problem, you want to find the right questions. Think, how do you apply things in your career?

Confusing Designs: If your conceptual model doesn't work with what you think. Good design: Excellent feedback, easy to discover things but hard to make mistakes.

Tyg: A cup that make it easy to share a cup with you. Multiple handles are signifiers and are useful.

__Affordance:__ The relationship between an object and a person. Ex: Car door. The handle has a different color so it means something, and there is a space for a handle where your hand fits.

We can have "fake affordances" or anti-affordances, such as the posts that "block" a driveway. People think that cars won't pass through, but employees know that cars can pass through (they bend when a car passes over them).

__Signifiers:__ Communication devices that tell what people are supposed to do. People search for clues that might help them understand, and these signs are called signifiers. The Play and Pause buttons are pretty universal, so you know what to do. Usually, you are told what to do, and they are the same the world over. Same with clicking the video.

Missing signifiers: How would I know that pressing your hand over the car door handle shuts down the window?

Affordances = possible actions. Signifiers = Signal conveyed to a person. Something can be any one, or it can be both, or negative.

#### Five Deliberately Misleading Affordancse or Signifiers
- Almost anyting done by a magician. :)
- Secret doors (like those hidden behind bookcases).
- Fake video cameras and security warnings (trying to scare away criminals).
- A fake watch with additional dials which don't really work, lol.

You want to document stuff, such as pictures and shit to tell a story. Second, take a ton of pictures, use different lighting, but don't use flash.

Train station: If there are people waiting, maybe you didn't miss it. If there are no people, then maybe you missed it.

Project 1: Improve a confusing signifier.

## 2: Conceptual Model & System Image.

Chinese puzzle pot: You aren't supposed to know how it works!

Good refrigerator conceptual model: Temperature is in F or C. Bad: Numbers with no relation.

A conceptual model is an explanation of how something works. Sometimes they are inferred from the product themselves, sometimes they are learned over a course of time, in other situations they are passed from person to person. A good conceptual model makes a person know what the heck they should do, and in the absence of a designer, the person should still understand wth something does.

The system image is everything combined: affordances, signifiers, conceptual models, and instruction manuals (lol).

Chelsey's External Fixator: She can't see the adjustments that she has to do without a mirror. 

Home Heating System: It's possible that you have to set it to the highest level ever, so that it'd heat things faster, but most heaters are at the max anyway already, so better to leave it at 73F and wait for it to get there. :)

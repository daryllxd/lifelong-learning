## Design Tip: Never Use Black

We see dark things and assume they are black things, when in reality, it's very hard to find something that is pure black. Shadows aren't black!

Artist Wayne Thiebaud's work: His shadows are some of the most saturated parts of his paintings, and that's on the screen too.

Black overpowers everything else. When you put black next to a set of meticulously picked colors, black overpowers everything else. It stands out because it's not natural. All of the "black" everyday objects around you have some amount of light bouncing off of them, which means they aren't black, they're dark grey. That light probably has a tint to it, so they're not even dark grey, they're colored-dark grey.

Whenever you're working with grays, add a bit of color to them and they will feel less dull. *The amount of color you can add is proportional to how dark the color is.* I mix a small amount of yellow-orange into our grays. Why does the Facebook mobile interface feel so nice? Because all of those grays are pumped full of Facebook Blue.

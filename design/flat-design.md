# Flat Design

Flat design removes textures, patterns, shadows, bubbles, gradients, other shiny effects to focus on simplicity. Flat buttons still look clickable and input buttons still look editable.

Visitors need to know which areas are plain static content, and which other areas are clickable and draggable. Flat design can still use light shadows and edge effects to imply this interactivity.

*Think that the page is built around typography, and these boxes of text will inform the user how to interact with the page.*

Making something look simple makes it simpler to look at. It's much easier for users to find what they are actually looking for if they don't have to navigate textures and drop shadows and stuff.

Most users won't care if your background is subtly and artfully textured to look like paper. They also don't care that your buttons look like tiny pieces of candy that light up delightfully when they are hovered over. They probably wouldn't see the hover effects anyway as more and more of the Internet is being consumed on mobile.

If your product is hard to figure out when all the lipstick is taken off, then you didn't spend enough time structuring the app in a way that makes sense. *The CTA doesn't need to shine/blink to stand out, it should stand out because of the hierarchy you've set up on the page.*

Your product is easy to use because you designed information to be easy to find, because it's in the exact place the user is looking for it, because the text is clear and easy to read, because you crafted a user a flow that pulls them through the process seamlessly. You can't rely on drop shadows, gradients, or colors (some people surf on black and white).

*Your users are not stupid, you're just lazy. Your users will not sit, staring at their screen, befuddled because your buttons don't have the glassy exterior of a marble. If you've done your job, they can do theirs easily, and they'll love you for it.*

# The Principles of Flat Design

Flat design employs a strict two-dimensional style that is simply flat. The concept works without embellishment: no drop shadows, bevels, embossing, gradients or other tools that add depth.

Layers used in flat design do not intersect, leaving a distinct background image, foreground images or buttons, text and navigation.

*Flat design relies on a clear sense of hierarchy in the desing and placement of elements to make successful projects easy for users to understand and interact with.*

1. *Simple elements.* Simple buttons, icons. Each UI element should be simple and easy to click or tap. Interaction should be intuitive for users without a lot of in-design explanation.
2. *Focus on typography.* The tone of typefaces should match the overall design scheme. Type should be bolded and worded simple and efficiently. Consider a simple sans serif type family with plenty of variations and weights for the primary typography on a site using flat design. Type should also tell users how to use the design. Label buttons and other elements for increased ease of use and interactivity.
3. *Focus on color.* Flat design color palettes are often much brighter and more colorful than those for other sites. More hues (which tend to be vibrant). Primary and secondary colors are popular. *Retro colors: salmon, purple, green, blue.*

Almost flat design: Some effects are added to the design scheme. Buttons may contain slight gradients or drop shadows. Designers typically pick one effect and use it exclusively in an almost flat project.

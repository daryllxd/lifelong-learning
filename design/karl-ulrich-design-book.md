1—Introduction to Design
* Design is confusing because we use it to represent a lot of things.
* Design is a verb and a noun.
* In modern enterprises, the order is sometimes reversed. The designer sometimes begins with an artifact and searches for a gap that it might fill. For instance, DuPont discovered the compound polytetrafluoroethylene (i.e., Teflon) accidentally and then proceeded over many decades to find gaps that the artifact could address.
What Is Good Design?
* Most design domains have not even been formalized, making the inherent complexity even greater and the prospect of optimality even more distant.
* Design quality is derived from how well the artifact satisfies user needs, and thereby closes the perceptual gap in the user experience.
2— Problem Solving and Design
Benjamin Franklin
* Franklin’s narrative follows the design process. 
* Franklin sensed a gap (vision out of focus),
* defined a problem (objects at different distances require different optical correction),
* searched for a solution, 
* and then selected a plan (a lens formed from two halves, each with a different diopter).
 
7—Aesthetics in Design
* An aesthetic response is most frequently stimulated by visual information, largely because the vision system provides data more immediately and at higher rates than do the other senses.
* All other things equal, most users will prefer a beautiful artifact to an ugly one, even in highly functional domains such as scientific instruments.
* First impressions matter, and overcoming an initial aesthetic repulsion is a substantial
* challenge for the designer, better avoided in the first place.
* beauty may serve as a signal for unobservable attributes of quality, much as a
* brand does for products and services.
Evolutionary Aesthetics

Historical Precedents
* Aristotle explicitly argued that a stable, unchanging human psychological nature would dictate that the arts would possess specifiable, unchanging features.
* Ex of tragedy: disruption of normal family relations (Oedipus and Medea). Family stress represents a permanent feature of human interest, not just for Greeks.
* Hume: "General principles of taste are uniform in human nature”. If human nature were not uniform across historic time and across cultures, we could not enjoy the same works of art as the ancients. Hume’s criterion: stands the “test of time”.
* Kant: “Judgments of taste” are subjective but we have a shared human sense, discussion and agreement with regard to art and aesthetic experience was also possible.
Evolutionary Psychology: Natural Selection
* Not Tabula Rasa. Evolutionary psychology posits the existence of innate interests, capacities, and tastes, laid down through processes of natural and sexual selection.
* Ex of Stone Age mind: Language use according to syntactic rules; kinship systems with incest avoidance; phobias, e.g. fear of snakes and spiders; child-nurturing interests; nepotism, the favouring of blood relations; a sense of justice, fairness, and obligations associated with emotions of anger and revenge; the capacity to make and use hand tools; status and rank ordering in human relations; a sense of food purity and contamination.
* Some are gender-specific: females are more inclined towards an interest in child nurturing and have a greater ability to remember details in visual experience, while males are more physically aggressive, and better able to determine directionality and engage in “map reading.”
* There exists no known human culture that does not display some form of expressive making that European cultures would identify as artistic.
* Pleasures, pains, and emotion-including experiences of attraction, revulsion, awe, fear, love, respect, loathing-have adaptive relevance.
Environmental Preference
* Children showed a marked preference for savannahs with trees-exactly the East African landscape where much early human evolution took place.
* There  is a general preference for landscapes with water; a variety of open and wooded space (indicating places to hide and places for game to hide); trees that fork near the ground (provide escape possibilities) with fruiting potential a metre or two from the ground; vistas that recede in the distance, including a path or river that bends out of view but invites exploration; the direct presence or implication of game animals; and variegated cloud patterns.
* Blue turned out to be the favourite colour worldwide, with green in second place. Respondents expressed a liking for realistic paintings. Preferred elements included water, trees and other plants, human beings (with a preference for women and children, and also for historical figures), and large mammals.
* This is why calendars are similar worldwide.
* Thinking through imagined alternative strategies to meet difficulties — these are at the heart of what the arts allow us to do. In fictional narratives, we meet a far greater variety of obstacles, along with potential solutions, than we ever could in a single life.
Evolutionary Psychology: Sexual Selection
* Geoffrey Miller: Sexual selection is the source of the traits we tend to find the most endearingly human-qualities of character, talent, and demeanour — but that artistic creativity and enjoyment came into being in the Pleistocene in the process of women and men choosing sexual partners.
* Sexual selection: responsible for the astonishingly large human brain, an organ whose peculiar capacities wildly exceed survival needs on the African savannahs.
* Things hard to explain in terms of survival: “humor, story-telling, gossip, art, music, self-consciousness, ornate language, imaginative ideologies, religion, morality”.
* Vocabulary: nonhuman primates have up to twenty distinct calls. The average human knows perhaps 60,000 words, learned at an average of ten to twenty a day up to age 18. As 98 per cent of daily speech uses only about 4,000 words, and no more than a couple of thousand words at most would have sufficed in the Pleistocene, the excess vocabulary is well explained by sexual selection theory as a fitness and general intelligence indicator.
* Vocabulary size is more strongly correlated to intelligence, which is why it is still used both in scientific testing and more generally by people automatically to gauge how clever a person is. Extravagant use of language is associated worldwide with love, being a kind of cognitive foreplay.
* Beauty equals difficulty and high cost. We find attractive those things that could have been produced only by people with attractive, high-fitness qualities such as health, energy, endurance, hand-eye coordination, fine motor control, intelligence, creativity, access to rare materials, the ability to learn difficult skills, and lots of free time” his view accords with a persistent intuition about art that can be traced from the Greeks to Nietzsche and Freud: art is somehow connected, at base, to sex.
Cultural Aesthetics
* The evidence is overwhelming that many aesthetic judgments differ widely across time and across cultures.
* One manifestation of cultural phenomena is the emergence of schools of design or design
* movements.
* The Memphis movement was formed in 1981 as a consortium of Italian designers led by
* Ettore Sottsass. The movement was essentially a reaction against modernism, which was to
* a large extent an outgrowth of the Bauhaus. The Memphis designers produced whimsical,
* colorful, and even illogical artifacts.
* many mechanisms, even if invariant across the species, operate on
* symbols and not on minimally processed sensory inputs, and the values of the symbols on
* which the mechanisms operate may vary widely
* For example, psychological mechanisms for determining status, prestige, and rank
* appear to be quite universal, but operate on symbols whose values depend on context.
* In
* one setting the symbols associated with status may be derived from body piercing and in
* another from a large automobile.
KT's Theory
* The phenomena we lump together into aesthetic response are actually the result of
* many different psychological mechanisms.
*  These mechanisms operate on basic sensory inputs and on symbols derived from
* these inputs and from memory.
*  The psychological mechanisms that we consider aesthetic operate very rapidly and
* may be superseded by a more deliberate formation of preference based on cognitive
* analysis over longer time periods.
*  Some important and significant aesthetic responses are vestigial adaptations for
* detecting physical features that were useful in an evolutionary sense.
*  Other important and significant aesthetic responses are adaptations that operate on
* symbols derived from learning, experience, and cultural context.
First Impresions Matter
* I conjecture that aesthetic responses influence subsequent analytical
* determination of preference.
* Specifically, a positive aesthetic response is more likely to lead
* to a positive ultimate preference than if the initial aesthetic response were negative.
* First, and obviously, beauty itself
* is by definition preferred and so given similar analytical preferences, the beautiful artifact
* should still be preferred over the ugly artifact.
* Second, and more subtly, an initially positive
* aesthetic response may result in a greater chance of further analysis and exploration by the
* user
* A negative aesthetic response may dissuade the user from ever learning more about the
* artifact and therefore reduces the chance that an ugly, but otherwise preferred, artifact will
* ever be fully evaluated. Third, I suspect that aesthetic preferences are “sticky.” That is,
* positive aesthetic judgments create a positive bias that persists even in the face of mounting
* negative analytical evidence.
* There were no cell phones in our evolutionary past, and yet when we see a cell phone, our
* stone-age sensory system and aesthetic adaptations are involuntarily invoked.
* I propose that for most modern artifacts, our most immediate
* aesthetic responses are vestigial; that is, they are the result of adaptations that were useful in
* our evolutionary past.
Aesthetic features are honest signals of quality
* Signals are essential elements of our means of making sense of the world.
* In order to be honest, a signal must be difficult or costly to fake. In economic terms, it
* must provide more net benefit (benefit minus cost) for a more fit signaler than it does for a
* less fit signaler.
* Mithen (2003) has done a fascinating study of ancient hand axes, possibly the first
* aesthetic artifacts. Apparently, our ancestors developed an aesthetic preference for highly
* symmetric, carefully crafted stone hand axes. The leading theory of this aesthetic preference
* is that beautiful hand axes were honest signals of male fitness.
* A male who could be directly
* observed to craft a beautiful hand ax was one who (1) had access to scarce resources like
* 106
* obsidian, (2) had excellent strength, dexterity, and fine motor skills, and (3) could afford to
* sit and make axes for hours at a time and still survive.
* In an analogous way, deliberate investment in designing aesthetically pleasing artifacts
* can be used by producers and consumers as an honest signal of the quality of the artifact.
* In a profit-
* maximizing setting, the producer who stands to benefit the most from this investment is the
* one who produces goods that are preferred upon closer inspection and that will deliver long-
* term satisfaction to the user.
Artifacts have symbolic value in social systems

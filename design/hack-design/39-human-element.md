## The Human Element

###[Transitional Interfaces](https://medium.com/design-ux/926eb80d64e3)

but there's little consideration about how it all fits together outside of a static comp. You tap a button and the form just ...appears? You swipe to delete an item and it just vanishes? That’s super weird and un-natural. Nearly nothing in the real world does anything as jarringly as just swapping states. It would feel like a glitch.

Oh, ok sweet. You made some notes — it just “slides in.”

How? Quickly? Does it bounce back? Cushion in? Static design doesn't provide context between states.

Folks keep throwing around the word “delight” when referring to animation and cute interactions. Cool and great for those guys. Guess what though? Animation can be used functionally too. It's not just an embellished detail.

- Inserting an item into a list: List makes room for the item, then the new item comes into the space. Add easing. For removing: Drag out the way it came from?
- List items: Slide? We can also make everything else hide within the same view.

It seems crazy to me that more people don’t think about interfaces with respect to the dimension of time. Motion can provide so much information! 

## Futurist Mobile Interaction Design

The movement toward mobile-dominant design is not just about designing for smartphones or tablets, but also about the challenge of designing an experience across the different devices that people use every day. 

Although the experience should feel homogeneous in some ways, there is the further challenge of taking advantage of each device’s natural setting and unique potential.

Mobile touch experiences haven’t exactly ushered in a new wave of design thinking. Not much has changed since the GUI windowing systems of the early 1970’s - we’ve got pictures under glass with click events replaced by touch events.

We’ve found the navigation bar to be problematic because smartphones have small screens, and navbars hog precious pixels that could be used for content.

Our design philosophy is all about being content-centric, so we wanted to see if we could totally remove the use of the standard top and bottom navbars from all our products. We knew we wanted more vertical space to do better layouts with bigger images.

Why do we still have navbars everywhere? We got our answer as soon as we got rid of them. The navbar is a standard one-size-fits-all navigation metaphor. Eliminating the navbar means reimagining your product’s navigation interactions, because they all tend to live on the navbar.

Eliminating legacy structure and navigation violates user expectations. So if you want to do it, you need to have something else that’s more natural for your product, and you need to execute it perfectly.

Prismatic is a news discovery product that focuses on finding new stuff. The more cool new stuff you find, the more you want to keep it organized, favorite it, share it, group it, etc. So you end up with these two modes of your stuff and finding new stuff. We decided to design around this core home-explore duality. Your home feed, your activity (read, shared, favorited), and your interests are all your stuff. The global feed, search, and suggested interests are all about finding new stuff.

## A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design

My problem is the opposite, really — this vision, from an interaction perspective, is not visionary. It's a timid increment from the status quo, and the status quo, from an interaction perspective, is actually rather terrible.

This matters, because visions matter. Visions give people a direction and inspire people to act, and a group of inspired people is the most powerful force in the world. If you're a young person setting off to realize a vision, or an old person setting off to fund one, I really want it to be something worthwhile. Something that genuinely improves how we interact.

 A tool addresses human needs by amplifying human capabilities. That is, a tool converts what we can do into what we want to do. A great tool is designed to fit both sides.

In this rant, I'm not going to talk about human needs. Everyone talks about that; it's the single most popular conversation topic in history.

And I'm not going to talk about technology. That's the easy part, in a sense, because we control it. Technology can be invented; human nature is something we're stuck with.

I'm going to talk about that neglected third factor, human capabilities. What people can do. Because if a tool isn't designed to be used by a person, it can't be a very good tool, right?

# The 4 questions you should stop asking during your one-on-one meetings
[Reference](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-4-questions-you-should-stop-asking-during-your-one-on-one-meetings-ed7431da11aa)

- "How's it going" => "How's life" (how is the side project going along, how is your family doing, how are they managing the workload.
- "What's the latest on so-and-so?" *A one-on-one is not a reporting session. It's not an accountability tool. It is a way to unearth what's going on in your team, and what an employee is thinking and feeling.* => "Can you tell me about what's been most surprising about working on X so far?"
- Instead of "how can I help you", suggest "I think I'm being too hands-on this project. Should I back off and check-in with you only bi-weekly? What do you think?"
- "How can we improve?" => the problem with this vague question is they invite vague answers.
  - "What do you think is the most overlooked area of the business?"
  - "Where do you think are we behind in, that other companies are excelling at?"

# An Adult’s Guide to Social Skills, for Those Who Were Never Taught
[Reference](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/smarter-living/adults-guide-to-social-skills.html)

- Emotional intelligence: The ability to acknowledge your own emotions, recognise emotions in others, and use that information to guide your behaviour.
  - Self-awareness: Being able to identify your own emotions and how they work. Are you anxious in loud environments? Do you get angry when people talk over you? If you know these things about yourself, then you're practicing self-awareness.
  - Self-regulation: You can not just show your emotions, but also manager them. If you get angry, you know how to calm yourself down. It can also deal with managing the emotions you will face. If you know that stalking your ex's Facebook is going to make you feel bad, then you would just do something to better your own life instead.
  - Motivation: External factors are powerful, but internal motivators, doing things because you want to do it, probably better.
  - Empathy: Important to be aware of the emotions of others. This might mean developing the skills to recognize how people are expressing themselves, and understanding how other people may respond to the circumstances they're in.
  - Socialization: Not controlling others, but understanding how to get where you want to be with other people.
- Constructively confronting someone:
  - Recognise the fear in yourself and identify the real issues that led you to the conflict in the first place. Ignoring how you feel about it won't resolve the conflict.
  - How do you react to being talked over? Go with the flow in group conversations. When you can jump in, speak loudly and with confidence.
- Making new friends as an adult: start with some internal motivation. Put yourself in positions where you can meet people again and again. Take a class, join a club, or just talk to people you know but aren't friends with yet. If you find someone you want to be friends with, put it on the top of your to-do list to follow up.
- Talking to a stranger for the first time: People like to talk about themselves. Everyone feels awkward when they are on their own. Most of us are willing to have a conversation, we just don't always want to be the one to make the first move.
- If someone is not busy, start by saying hello or opening with a compliment. From there, you can do "insight and question" method. Offer an observation/insight, follow it up with a question, and let the conversation flow naturally.

# Disclosing information about the self is intrinsically rewarding
[Reference](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224919007_Disclosing_information_about_the_self_is_intrinsically_rewarding)

- Individuals place high subjective value on opportunities to communicate their thoughts and feelings to others and that doing so engages neural and cognitive mechanisms associated with reward.
- Self-disclosure was associated with increased activation in brain regions in the dopamine system.
- 30-40% of speech output are dedicated to talking about their own experiences or relationships.

# How to Make Friends
[Reference](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/24/smarter-living/the-edit-how-to-make-friends.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)

- Making friends is simple: most people are flattered that someone cool wants to befriend them.
- Become a person who is comfortable spouting non-sequiturs. Friendship starts by talking, which means that someone has to start talking! Comment on the weather, the smell of the room, or something on TV last night.
- With some rapport, you can divulge a tiny secret.
- Then, wait a period of time, then refer back to the thing you divulged to them! You are creating an inside joke, the foundation of friendship.
- Then, ask them to hang out at some point.
- Transmit the message that you are friendly by asking co-workers with bite-sized questions about their lives and jobs. Most people think you have demonstrated good taste by being interested in them, but if they give curt answers or avoid eye contact, then they aren't looking to make a friend right now.
- Continuing education classes are a great way to meet new people!

# How to Have Closer Friendships (and Why You Need Them)
[Reference](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/smarter-living/how-to-have-closer-friendships.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)

- Close friendships are necessary for optimal health and well-being. Being intimate with another person can make us experience positive mental and physical reactions in our body, mind, and heart.
- If you are in distress, being in proximity to someone you're securely attached to is the most effective way to calm yourself.
- *When people close to us don't "get" us, it's undermining to intimacy.* A big part of intimacy is that both people feel they are seen and understood by the other person.
- Close friendships are important to us *because* they are so difficult to form. Humans could have evolved a built-in bias against easily making friends because avoiding an enemy would have been more important than making a friend.
- Sociology: do humans want to be admired, or do they want to be known? She explained that admiration came with perks - it feels good, it has social benefits, there is some social status. But being admired and seen in ways that don't line up with how we see ourselves can come at the cost of feeling understood by and close to others.
- Culturally, we are also more focused on career success, financial accomplishments, and family milestones than we are on connection with others.
- To make your friendships closer:
  - Create a foundation of security. Are they consistent, available, reliable, responsive (they reply to texts), and can you count on them?
  - Give people full attention, especially when they are sharing about their life.
  - Let yourself be known, not be admired? You have to understand and accept yourself enough that you believe you can make somebody else's life better just be being in it. Just be more honest about who you are, and you can get more intimate with others. Next time you are with a friend, start diverting the conversation into exposing more vulnerability. When your friend responds in a way that feels supportive, give positive feedback by saying how helpful that was, or what a good perspective your friend has.
  - Testing a person if they are reliable enough: When we give someone a chance to show up for us, we pose an opportunity for greater bonding and closeness.

# Why Is It Hard to Make Friends Over 30?
[Reference](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)

- At 30, people tend to focus on what is most emotionally important to you - so you're not interested in going to that cocktail party, you're interested in spending time with your kids.
- The conditions: proximity, repeated/unplanned interactions, a setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other.
- Work friendships often take on a transactional feel; it is difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins.
- After 30, people experience internal shifts in how they approach friendship. Self-discover gives way to self-knowledge, so you become pickier about whom you surround yourself with.

# How to ask good questions
[Reference](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/)

- Find a good time.
- State what you know. "Is that right? So from my understanding, x." Stating your understanding is not easy because it makes you clarify your thoughts, but it works really well and it makes it a lot easier for the person you're asking to help you.
- Ask factual questions. When asking, people might not know the answer to the question, but they are least understand the kind of question that I'm asking or I'm interested in.
- Be willing to say what you don't understand - if someone doesn't ask me for clarifications, then I worry that they're not listening.
- Do some research before asking a question.
- Ask questions to show what's not obvious.

# How to answer questions in a helpful way
[Reference](https://jvns.ca/blog/answer-questions-well/)

- If they're not asking clearly, help them clarify - rephrase a more specific question, ask them for more specific information, and ask what prompted their question.
- Figure out what they know already.
- Point them to a useful search: "this is the search I'd use to find the answer to that question".
- Write new documentation: If a question is being asked again and again, the answer doesn't change too much over time.
- If you're explaining how you debugged a problem, it's useful to explain how you found what the problem was, and how you found out what the problem wasn't. It's better to help someone improve at learning and diagnosis.
- Ask, "did that answer your question"?

# How To Do Better In Loud, Crazy Group Conversations
[Reference](https://www.succeedsocially.com/groupconversations)

- Crazy conversations:
  - Hectic, impatient, excitable vibe.
  - Several people are talking at once.
  - Interruptions are common.
  - Everyone is talking loudly, volume gradually increases as people try to talk over each other to get their point across.
  - Conversation doesn't stay on one topic for all that long.
  - Conversation threads can easily get derailed.
  - Immaturity, stupid jokes, and showing off are fairly common.
- Conversations like this - they're loud, scattered, inconsiderate, and "dog eat dog". They are more for fun, cheap laughs, spirited debate, light entertainment, socialising for its own sake, enjoying the company of friends.
- You're probably not going to have an in-depth, logical discussion.
- Just tolerate the noise and stimulation so you can make something out of it. Don't feel resentful because everyone isn't more toned down, that's just the way these things are.
- In these conversations, everyone is excited and wants to talk, and they'd rather it be them than you. If you want to say something, you've got to fight and get your share of the air space.
- In these conversations, you have to be quicker and get to the point faster. Figure out what you want to say more quickly.

# How To Keep A Conversation Going: 12 No Nonsense Tips!
[Reference](https://www.aconsciousrethink.com/9633/how-to-keep-a-conversation-going/)

- Small talk: It allows us to do the very human thing of assessing the other person and getting an idea of what makes them tick.
- Choose Subjects You Know The Other Person Finds Interesting. Weather can be -> skiing trip or the predicted heat wave.
- Open questions - "You mentioned you went to Costa Rica last year. What was the weather/the beach/the wildlife like?"
- What to Why. Like "Why did you move here" or something. If the other person seems in any way uncomfortable, be sure to back pedal and return to safer ground with less penetrating, neutral questions.
- Make regular eye contact as the conversation flows along as this is another indicator of the level of your attention.
- You don't have to pepper your conversation with witty one-liners or even tell jokes. A well-timed sarcastic or self-deprecating comment can raise a laugh just as well.
- Silence: It can give you a chance to gather your thoughts. It can also indicate that a topic has reached its natural conclusion or has become a tad too intense for comfort and allows for a change of tack.

# Ask HN: How to Be Funny and Likable?
[Reference](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33784718)

- Don’t state the obvious. In this case obvious is anything that is already known to your audience. People frequently do this in an attempt to be clever or appear intelligent, but it’s neither.
- Don’t be clever. Clever is the attempt to short-circuit logic to arrive at a conclusion in seemingly fewer steps. This tends to backfire with either incorrect conclusions or logical fallacies that don’t make sense.
- Don’t self promote. If you want to be likable never talk about yourself except for moments of private self disclosure.
- Don’t interject into a conversation unless you have an exceptionally important reason for doing so.
- Have empathy, the non cognitive ability to anticipate the pains and pleasures of others. Don’t guess at this. Read people, read the room, and then qualify your assessments with pointed questions. You have to naturally and innately want to do this.
- Be direct. This means starting with a conclusion, but be prepared to progressively step through the logic only if asked.
- Be honest. You cannot achieve trust without honesty. Many people find directness and honesty challenging.
- Be available. This means an eagerness to exit your current focus and redirect yourself to the needs of someone else instantly without prior notice. When this is not possible respond with why and when you will be available.
- Be helpful, which means an eagerness to spend time and effort to solve a problem with someone else, a problem that do not own and will not be awarded for.
- If you wish to be humorous amplify logical directness with a play on words or through gross amplification, particularly when that directness comes at the expense of somebody else. If in practice this will require any kind of explanation then don’t do it.
- **I think the key thing to being funny is to actually find humor in situations and be willing to share it with others, but not at the expanse of someone. So, it requires a mind always eager to find the positive side in almost every circumstance. There's no formula, but my usual methodology is to use logical analogy, but in a very absurd way. I describe logical scenes, emphasizing on certain actions which would never really happen, but could fit if the people were in a comedy movie.**
- As to being likable, empathy, trust, and generosity go a long way. You have to understand how people feel and let people understand that you are a reliable person. Occasionally, it doesn't click as they have a different philosophy of life and that's okay.
- Have some business safe Normal People things to talk about. I do genuinely like sports but I made lots of friends with sales/marketing/execs/finance/etc. When I could ask them how their team was doing (or whatever) vs. The 10,000 technical weirdo of the day. It doesn't have to be sports. I have cats. That is what work people know about me. They don't need to know how much I play video or that I'm really into RPGs or whatever right up front unless they are obviously into that.
- Ask questions. Not in an annoying way. But a lightly curious way. People leave signs all the time. Maybe their wallpaper is pictures of their kids or pet or car or boat or I dunno, whatever. Ask about it, just "oh is that your kids/dog/boat/etc.?" Ask a couple questions like how old they are. And then ask how they are doing every now and then when you talk to that person.

# Introduction

- Arguably the greatest mysteries in the universe lie in the three-pound mass of cells,
approximately the consistency of oatmeal, that reside in the skull of each of us. It has
even been suggested that the brain is so complex that our species is smart enough to
fathom everything except what makes us so smart; that is, the brain is so cunningly
designed for intelligence that it is too stupid to understand itself. We now know that is
not true. The mind is at last yielding its secrets to persistent scientific investigation.
We have learned more about how the mind works in the last twenty-five years than we
did in the previous twenty-five hundred.

# 1 - Why Don't Students Like School?

- Contrary to popular belief, the brain is not designed for  thinking. It's designed to save you from having to think, because the  brain is actually not very good at thinking. Thinking is slow and unreliable. Nevertheless, people enjoy mental work if it is successful.
- People like to solve  problems, but not to work on unsolvable problems. If schoolwork is always just a  bit too difficult for a student, it should be no surprise that she doesn't like school much.
- **People are naturally curious, but we are not naturally good thinkers; unless the cognitive conditions are right, we will avoid thinking.**
- They both had a point. Humans are good at certain types of reasoning, particularly in comparison to other animals, but we exercise those abilities infrequently. A cognitive scientist would add another observation: Humans don't think very often because our brains are designed not for thought but for the avoidance of thought. Thinking is not only effortful, as Ford noted, it's also slow and unreliable.
- Absolutely! Here’s your text rewritten so that each main thought is a single top-level bullet—each bullet represents a paragraph:

- Most problems we face in daily life have been solved before, so we often rely on memory rather than active thinking; this helps us get through our day efficiently, whether it's finding our way to work, shopping for groceries, or making decisions as a teacher.
- When we encounter a situation we've seen before, like a familiar puzzle or emergency (such as a boiling pot), we quickly respond with what we've learned previously, rather than stopping to analyze each detail or consequence.
- For many everyday choices—like deciding what to make for dinner—we don’t typically weigh every possible option or consequence; instead, we follow our usual patterns and routines, which psychologists say accounts for much of our behavior.
- When we operate on "autopilot," even during complex tasks like driving, memory takes over; this frees up our attention so that we can daydream or think about other things while still successfully completing necessary actions.
- While it’s possible to make each decision with thoughtful consideration, constantly analyzing even routine tasks would be exhausting, which is why we reserve careful thinking for less familiar or more important situations.
- Traveling often forces us out of autopilot; in a new environment—especially where we don’t speak the language—every small action demands extra thought and attention, making seemingly simple tasks, like buying a soda, much more challenging and tiring.
- Our brains are wired to use memory rather than active reasoning for most actions; as we repeat tasks, those tasks become automatic, requiring less thought and allowing us to conserve mental energy.
## People Are Naturally Curious, but Curiosity Is Fragile

- Even though the brain is not set up for very efficient thinking, people actually enjoy mental activity, at least in some circumstances. We have hobbies like solving crossword puzzles or scrutinizing maps. We watch information-packed documentaries. We pursue careers- such as teaching- that offer greater mental challenge than competing careers, even if the pay is lower. Not only are we willing to think, we intentionally seek out situations that demand thought.
- It's notable too that the pleasure is in the solving of the problem. Working on a prob- lem with no sense that you're making progress is not pleasurable. In fact, it's frustrat- ing. Then too, there's not great pleasure in simply knowing the answer. I told you the solution to the candle problem; did you get any fun out of it? Think how much more fun it would have been if you had solved it yourself—in fact, the problem would have seemed more clever, just as a joke that you get is funnier than a joke that has to be explained. Even if someone doesn't tell you the answer to a problem, once you've had too many hints you lose the sense that you've solved the problem, and getting the answer doesn't bring the same mental snap of satisfaction.

- So, if content is not enough to keep your attention, when does curiosity have staying power? The answer may lie in the difficulty of the problem. If we get a little burst of pleasure from solving a problem, then there's no point in working on a problem that is too easy—there'll be no pleasure when it's solved because it didn't feel like much of a problem in the first place. Then too, when you size up a problem as very difficult, you are judging that you're unlikely to solve it, and are therefore unlikely to get the satisfaction that comes with the solution. A crossword puzzle that is too easy is just mindless work: you fill in the squares, scarcely thinking about it, and there's no gratifi- cation, even though you're getting all the answers. But you're unlikely to work long at a crossword puzzle that's too difficult.
- dog generally looks like. All of the information in long- FIGURE 6: Just about the simplest model of the mind possible. term memory resides outside of awareness. It lies quietly until it is needed, and then enters working memory and so becomes conscious. For example, if I asked you, "What color is a polar bear?" you would say, "white" almost immediately. That information was in long-term memory thirty second ago, but you weren't aware of it until I posed the question that made it relevant to ongoing thought, whereupon it entered working memory.
- For example: Try `18 x 7` - you could do it directly or you can do `10 x 7 + 8 x 7`.
- Let me summarize what I've said in this chapter. People's minds are not especially well-suited to thinking; thinking is slow, effortful, and uncertain. For this reason, deliberate thinking does not guide people's behavior in most situations. Rather, we rely on our memories, following courses of action that we have taken before. Nevertheless, we find successful thinking pleasurable. We like solving problems, under- standing new ideas, and so forth. Thus, we will seek out opportunities to think, but we are selective in doing so; we choose problems that pose some challenge but that seem likely to be solvable, because these are the problems that lead to feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. For problems to be solved, the thinker needs adequate information from the environment, room in working memory, and the required facts and proce- dures in long-term memory.

## Implications for the Classroom

- **Be Sure That There Are Problems to Be Solved.** By problem I don't necessarily mean a question addressed to the class by the teacher, or a mathematical puzzle. I mean cognitive work that poses moderate challenge, including such activities as understanding a poem or thinking of novel uses for recyclable materi- als. This sort of cognitive work is of course the main stuff of teaching—we want our students to think. But without some attention, a lesson plan can become a long string of teacher explanations, with little opportunity for students to solve problems. So scan each lesson plan with an eye toward the cognitive work that students will be doing. How often does such work occur? Is it intermixed with cognitive breaks? When you have identified the challenges, consider whether they are open to negative outcomes such as students failing to understand what they are to do, or students being unlikely to solve the problem, or students simply trying to guess what you would like them to say or do.
- **Respect Students' Cognitive Limits.** When trying to develop effective mental challenges for your students, bear in mind the cognitive limitations discussed in this chapter. For example, suppose you began a history lesson with a question: "You've all heard of the Boston Tea Party; why do you suppose the colonists dressed as Indians and dumped tea into the Boston harbor?" Do your students have the necessary background knowledge in memory to consider this question? What do they know about the relationship of the colonies and the Brit- ish crown in 1773? Do they know about the social and economic significance of tea? Could they generate reasonable alternative courses of action? If they lack the appro- priate background knowledge, the question you pose will quickly be judged as "bor- ing." If students lack the background knowledge to engage with a problem, save it for another time when they have that knowledge. Equally important is the limit on working memory. Remember that people can keep only so much information in mind at once, as you experienced when you read the tea-ceremony version of the discs-and-pegs problem. Overloads of working memory are caused by such things as multistep instructions, lists of unconnected facts, chains of logic more than two or three steps long, and the application of a just-learned concept to new material (unless the concept is quite simple). The solution to work- ing memory overloads is straightforward: slow the pace, and use memory aids such as writing on the blackboard that save students from keeping too much information in working memory.
- **Clarifying the Problems to Be Solved.** How can you make the problem interesting? A common strategy is to try to make the material "relevant" to students. This strategy sometimes works well, but it's hard to use for some material. Another difficulty is that a teacher's class may include two football fans, a doll collector, a NASCAR enthusiast, a horseback riding competitor-you get the idea. Mentioning a popular singer in the course of a history lesson may give the class a giggle, but it won't do much more than that. I have emphasized that our curios- ity is provoked when we perceive a problem that we believe we can solve. What is the question that will engage students and make them want to know the answer? One way to view schoolwork is as a series of answers. We want students to know Boyle's law, or three causes of the U.S. Civil War, or why Poe's raven kept saying, "Nevermore." Sometimes I think that we, as teachers, are so eager to get to the answers that we do not devote sufficient time to developing the question. But as the information in this chapter indicates, it's the question that piques people's interest. Being told an answer doesn't do anything for you. You may have noted that I could have organized this book around principles of cognitive psychology. Instead I orga- nized it around questions that I thought teachers would find interesting.
- The core idea presented in this chapter is that solving a problem gives people pleasure, but the problem must be easy enough to be solved yet difficult enough to take some mental effort. Finding this sweet spot of difficulty is not easy. Your experience in the classroom is your best guide--whatever works, do again; whatever doesn't, discard. But don't expect that you will really remember how well a lesson plan worked a year later. Whether a lesson goes brilliantly well or down in flames, it feels at the time that we'll never forget what happened; but the ravages of memory can surprise us, so write it down. Even if it's just a quick scratch on a sticky note, try to make a habit of record- ing your success in gauging the level of difficulty in the problems you pose for your students.

# 2 - How Can I Teach Students the Skills They Need When Standardized Tests Require Only Facts?

- Question: Much has been written about fact learning, most of it negative. The narrow-minded schoolmaster demanding that students parrot facts they do not understand has become a cliché of American education, although the stereotype is neither new nor exclusively American—Dickens used it in Hard Times, published in 1854.
- Answer: There is no doubt that having students memorize lists of dry facts is not enriching. It is also true (though less often appreciated) that trying to teach students skills such as analysis or synthesis in the absence of factual knowledge is impossible. Research from cognitive science has shown that the sorts of skills that teachers want for students—such as the ability to analyze and to think critically—require extensive factual knowledge. The cognitive prin- ciple that guides this chapter is: **Factual knowledge must precede skill.**
- It's easy to see why a teacher, parent, or student would protest that knowing the answer to a lot of these questions doesn't prove that one really knows science or history. We want our students to think, not simply to memorize. When someone shows evidence of thinking critically, we consider her smart and well educated. When someone spouts facts without context, we consider her boring and a show-off. That said, there are obvious cases in which everyone would agree that factual knowledge is necessary. When a speaker uses unfamiliar vocabulary, you may not understand what he means. For example, if a friend sent you an e-mail telling you she thought your daughter was dating a "yegg," you'd certainly want to know the definition of the word (Figure 1). Similarly, you may know all of the vocabulary
- The necessity of background knowledge for comprehension is pretty obvious, at least as I've described it so far. You could summarize this view by noting that to think is a transitive verb. You need something to think about.
- We've all known someone who talks that way (and we try to avoid him or her), but not many; most writers and speakers feel safe omitting some information. How do writers (and speakers) decide what to omit? It depends on whom they're writing for (or speaking to). Have a look at Figure 4. What would the woman pictured there say if someone asked her, "What are you doing?"
- If she were talking to a two-year-old she might say, "I'm typing on a computer." But that would be a ridiculous answer for an adult. Why? Because the typist should assume that the adult knows she's typing. A more appropriate response might be, "I'm filling out a form." Thus we calibrate our answers, providing more or less (or different) information depending on our judgment of what the other person knows, thereby deciding what we can safely leave out and what needs to be explained. *
- A number of studies have shown that people understand what they read much better if they already have some background knowledge about the subject. Part of the reason is chunking. A clever study on this point was conducted with junior high school students.? Half were good readers and half were poor readers, according to standard reading tests. The researchers asked the students to read a story that described half an inning of a baseball game. As they read, the students were periodically stopped and asked to show that they understood what was happening in the story by using a model of a baseball field and players. The interesting thing about this study was that some of the students knew a lot about baseball and some knew just a little.
- **I've listed four ways that background knowledge is important to reading comprehension: (1) it provides vocabulary; (2) it allows you to bridge logical gaps that writers leave; (3) it allows chunking, which increases room in working memory and thereby makes it easier to tie ideas together; and (4) it guides the interpretation of ambiguous sentences. There are in fact other ways that background knowledge helps reading, but these are some of the highlights.**
- It's worth noting that some observers believe that this phenomenon-that knowledge makes you a good reader—is a factor in the fourth-grade slump. **If you're unfamiliar with that term, it refers to the fact that students from underprivileged homes often read at grade level through the third grade, but then suddenly in the fourth grade they fall behind, and with each successive year they fall even farther behind. The interpretation is that reading instruction through third grade focuses mostly on decoding-figuring out how to sound out words using the printed symbols—so that's what reading tests emphasize.** By the time the fourth grade rolls around, most students are good decoders, so reading tests start to emphasize comprehension. As described here, comprehension depends on background knowledge, and that's where kids from privileged homes have an edge. They come to school with a bigger vocabulary and more knowledge about the world than underprivileged kids. And because knowing things makes it easier to learn new things (as described in the next section), the gap between privileged and underprivileged kids widens.

## Background Knowledge is Necessary for Cognitive Skills

- First, you should know that much of the time when we see someone apparently engaged in logical thinking, he or she is actually engaged in memory retrieval. As I described in Chapter One, memory is the cognitive process of first resort. When faced with a problem, you will first search for a solution in memory, and if you find one, you will very likely use it. Doing so is easy and fairly likely to be effective; you probably remember the solution to a problem because it worked the last time, not because it failed. To appreciate this effect, first try a problem for which you don't have relevant background knowledge, such as the one shown in Figure 6.*
- Here's an example. Do you have a friend who can walk into someone else's kitchen and rapidly produce a nice dinner from whatever food is around, usually to the astonishment of whoever's kitchen it is? When your friend looks in a cupboard, she doesn't see ingredients, she see recipes. She draws on extensive background knowledge about food and cooking. For example, have a
- **FIGURE 10: Scientists are good at "thinking like scientists," but doing so depends not just on knowing and practicing the thinking strategies, but also on having background knowledge that allows them to use the thinking strategies. This may be why a well-known geologist, H. H. Read, said, "The best geologist is the one who has seen the most rocks.**
- You might think this effect is really due to attention. If I'm a basketball fan, I'll enjoy reading about basketball and will pay close attention, whereas if I'm not a fan, reading about basketball will bore me. But other studies have actually created experts. The researchers had people learn either a lot or just a little about subjects that were new to them (for example, Broadway musicals). Then they had them read other, new facts about the subject, and they found that the "experts" (those who had earlier learned a lot of facts about the subject) learned new facts more quickly and easily than the "novices" (who had earlier learned just a few facts about the subject)."
- I have of course made up all of the numbers in the foregoing example, but we know that the basics are correct-the rich get richer. We also know where the riches lie. If you want to be exposed to new vocabulary and new ideas, the places to go are books, magazines, and newspapers. Television, video games, and the sorts of Internet content that students lean toward (for example, social networking sites, music sites, and the like) are for the most part unhelpful. Researchers have painstakingly analyzed the contents of the many ways that students can spend their leisure time. Books, newspapers, and magazines are singularly helpful in introducing new ideas and new vocabulary to students.
- As an alternative to the quotations in Table 2, I offer a Spanish proverb that emphasizes the importance of experience and, by inference, knowledge: Mas sabe El Diablo por viejo que por Diablo. Roughly translated:"The Devil is not wise because he's the Devil. The Devil is wise because he's old."
- For reading, students must know whatever information writers assume they know and hence leave out. The necessary knowledge will vary depending on what students read, but most observers would agree that a reasonable minimum target would be to read a daily newspaper and to read books written for the intelligent layman on serious topics such as science and politics. Using that criterion, we may still be distressed that much
- Our goal is not simply to have students know a lot of stuff—it's to have them know stuff in service of being able to think effectively. **As emphasized in this chapter, think- ing critically requires background knowledge. Critical thinking is not a set of proce- dures that can be practiced and perfected while divorced from background knowledge. Thus it makes sense to consider whether students have the necessary background knowledge to carry out a critical thinking task you might assign. For example, I once observed a teacher ask her fourth-grade class what they thought it would be like to live in a rain forest. Although the students had spent a couple of days talking about rain forests, they didn't have the background knowledge to give anything beyond rather shallow responses (such as "It would be rainy"). She asked the same question at the end of the unit, and the student's answers were much richer. One student imme- diately said she wouldn't want to live there because the poor soil and constant shade would mean she would probably have to include meat in her diet—and she was a vegetarian.**
- The effects of knowledge described in this chapter also highlight why reading is so important. Books expose children to more facts and to a broader vocabulary than virtually any other activity, and persuasive data indicate that people who read for pleasure enjoy cognitive benefits throughout their lifetime. I don't believe it is quite the case that any book is fine "as long as they're reading." Naturally, if a child has a history of resisting reading, I'd be happy if she picked up any book at all. But once she is over that hump, I'd start trying to nudge her toward books at the appropriate reading level. It's rather obvious that a student doesn't gain much from reading books several grades below her reading level. I'm all for reading for pleasure, but there are fun, fascinating books at every reading level, so why not encourage age-appropriate materials? It's just as obvious that a too difficult book is a bad idea. The student won't understand it and will just end up frustrated. The school librarian should be a tremen- dous resource and ally in helping children learn to love reading, and she is arguably the most important person in any school when it comes to reading.
- At the end of the last section I noted that a child who starts behind in terms of knowledge will fall even farther behind unless there is some intervention. There seems to be little doubt that this is a major factor in why some children fare poorly in school. Home environments vary a great deal. What sort of vocabulary do parents use? Do the parents ask the children questions and listen to the children's answers? Do they take their child to the museum or aquarium? Do they make books available to their chil- dren? Do the children observe their parents reading? All of these factors (and others) likely play a role in what children know on their first day of school. In other words, before a child meets her first teacher, she may be quite far behind the child sitting next to her in terms of how easy it is going to be for her to learn. Trying to level this playing field is a teacher's greatest challenge. There are no shortcuts and no alternatives to trying to increase the factual knowledge that the child has not picked up at home.

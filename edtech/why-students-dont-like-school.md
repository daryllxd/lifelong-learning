# Introduction

- Arguably the greatest mysteries in the universe lie in the three-pound mass of cells,
approximately the consistency of oatmeal, that reside in the skull of each of us. It has
even been suggested that the brain is so complex that our species is smart enough to
fathom everything except what makes us so smart; that is, the brain is so cunningly
designed for intelligence that it is too stupid to understand itself. We now know that is
not true. The mind is at last yielding its secrets to persistent scientific investigation.
We have learned more about how the mind works in the last twenty-five years than we
did in the previous twenty-five hundred.

# 1 - Why Don't Students Like School?

- Contrary to popular belief, the brain is not designed for  thinking. It's designed to save you from having to think, because the  brain is actually not very good at thinking. Thinking is slow and unreliable. Nevertheless, people enjoy mental work if it is successful.
- People like to solve  problems, but not to work on unsolvable problems. If schoolwork is always just a  bit too difficult for a student, it should be no surprise that she doesn't like school much.
- **People are naturally curious, but we are not naturally good thinkers; unless the cognitive conditions are right, we will avoid thinking.**
- They both had a point. Humans are good at certain types of reasoning, particularly in comparison to other animals, but we exercise those abilities infrequently. A cognitive scientist would add another observation: Humans don't think very often because our brains are designed not for thought but for the avoidance of thought. Thinking is not only effortful, as Ford noted, it's also slow and unreliable.
- Absolutely! Here’s your text rewritten so that each main thought is a single top-level bullet—each bullet represents a paragraph:

- Most problems we face in daily life have been solved before, so we often rely on memory rather than active thinking; this helps us get through our day efficiently, whether it's finding our way to work, shopping for groceries, or making decisions as a teacher.
- When we encounter a situation we've seen before, like a familiar puzzle or emergency (such as a boiling pot), we quickly respond with what we've learned previously, rather than stopping to analyze each detail or consequence.
- For many everyday choices—like deciding what to make for dinner—we don’t typically weigh every possible option or consequence; instead, we follow our usual patterns and routines, which psychologists say accounts for much of our behavior.
- When we operate on "autopilot," even during complex tasks like driving, memory takes over; this frees up our attention so that we can daydream or think about other things while still successfully completing necessary actions.
- While it’s possible to make each decision with thoughtful consideration, constantly analyzing even routine tasks would be exhausting, which is why we reserve careful thinking for less familiar or more important situations.
- Traveling often forces us out of autopilot; in a new environment—especially where we don’t speak the language—every small action demands extra thought and attention, making seemingly simple tasks, like buying a soda, much more challenging and tiring.
- Our brains are wired to use memory rather than active reasoning for most actions; as we repeat tasks, those tasks become automatic, requiring less thought and allowing us to conserve mental energy.
## People Are Naturally Curious, but Curiosity Is Fragile

- Even though the brain is not set up for very efficient thinking, people actually enjoy mental activity, at least in some circumstances. We have hobbies like solving crossword puzzles or scrutinizing maps. We watch information-packed documentaries. We pursue careers- such as teaching- that offer greater mental challenge than competing careers, even if the pay is lower. Not only are we willing to think, we intentionally seek out situations that demand thought.
- It's notable too that the pleasure is in the solving of the problem. Working on a prob- lem with no sense that you're making progress is not pleasurable. In fact, it's frustrat- ing. Then too, there's not great pleasure in simply knowing the answer. I told you the solution to the candle problem; did you get any fun out of it? Think how much more fun it would have been if you had solved it yourself—in fact, the problem would have seemed more clever, just as a joke that you get is funnier than a joke that has to be explained. Even if someone doesn't tell you the answer to a problem, once you've had too many hints you lose the sense that you've solved the problem, and getting the answer doesn't bring the same mental snap of satisfaction.

- So, if content is not enough to keep your attention, when does curiosity have staying power? The answer may lie in the difficulty of the problem. If we get a little burst of pleasure from solving a problem, then there's no point in working on a problem that is too easy—there'll be no pleasure when it's solved because it didn't feel like much of a problem in the first place. Then too, when you size up a problem as very difficult, you are judging that you're unlikely to solve it, and are therefore unlikely to get the satisfaction that comes with the solution. A crossword puzzle that is too easy is just mindless work: you fill in the squares, scarcely thinking about it, and there's no gratifi- cation, even though you're getting all the answers. But you're unlikely to work long at a crossword puzzle that's too difficult.
- dog generally looks like. All of the information in long- FIGURE 6: Just about the simplest model of the mind possible. term memory resides outside of awareness. It lies quietly until it is needed, and then enters working memory and so becomes conscious. For example, if I asked you, "What color is a polar bear?" you would say, "white" almost immediately. That information was in long-term memory thirty second ago, but you weren't aware of it until I posed the question that made it relevant to ongoing thought, whereupon it entered working memory.
- For example: Try `18 x 7` - you could do it directly or you can do `10 x 7 + 8 x 7`.
- Let me summarize what I've said in this chapter. People's minds are not especially well-suited to thinking; thinking is slow, effortful, and uncertain. For this reason, deliberate thinking does not guide people's behavior in most situations. Rather, we rely on our memories, following courses of action that we have taken before. Nevertheless, we find successful thinking pleasurable. We like solving problems, under- standing new ideas, and so forth. Thus, we will seek out opportunities to think, but we are selective in doing so; we choose problems that pose some challenge but that seem likely to be solvable, because these are the problems that lead to feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. For problems to be solved, the thinker needs adequate information from the environment, room in working memory, and the required facts and proce- dures in long-term memory.

## Implications for the Classroom

- **Be Sure That There Are Problems to Be Solved.** By problem I don't necessarily mean a question addressed to the class by the teacher, or a mathematical puzzle. I mean cognitive work that poses moderate challenge, including such activities as understanding a poem or thinking of novel uses for recyclable materi- als. This sort of cognitive work is of course the main stuff of teaching—we want our students to think. But without some attention, a lesson plan can become a long string of teacher explanations, with little opportunity for students to solve problems. So scan each lesson plan with an eye toward the cognitive work that students will be doing. How often does such work occur? Is it intermixed with cognitive breaks? When you have identified the challenges, consider whether they are open to negative outcomes such as students failing to understand what they are to do, or students being unlikely to solve the problem, or students simply trying to guess what you would like them to say or do.
- **Respect Students' Cognitive Limits.** When trying to develop effective mental challenges for your students, bear in mind the cognitive limitations discussed in this chapter. For example, suppose you began a history lesson with a question: "You've all heard of the Boston Tea Party; why do you suppose the colonists dressed as Indians and dumped tea into the Boston harbor?" Do your students have the necessary background knowledge in memory to consider this question? What do they know about the relationship of the colonies and the Brit- ish crown in 1773? Do they know about the social and economic significance of tea? Could they generate reasonable alternative courses of action? If they lack the appro- priate background knowledge, the question you pose will quickly be judged as "bor- ing." If students lack the background knowledge to engage with a problem, save it for another time when they have that knowledge. Equally important is the limit on working memory. Remember that people can keep only so much information in mind at once, as you experienced when you read the tea-ceremony version of the discs-and-pegs problem. Overloads of working memory are caused by such things as multistep instructions, lists of unconnected facts, chains of logic more than two or three steps long, and the application of a just-learned concept to new material (unless the concept is quite simple). The solution to work- ing memory overloads is straightforward: slow the pace, and use memory aids such as writing on the blackboard that save students from keeping too much information in working memory.
- **Clarifying the Problems to Be Solved.** How can you make the problem interesting? A common strategy is to try to make the material "relevant" to students. This strategy sometimes works well, but it's hard to use for some material. Another difficulty is that a teacher's class may include two football fans, a doll collector, a NASCAR enthusiast, a horseback riding competitor-you get the idea. Mentioning a popular singer in the course of a history lesson may give the class a giggle, but it won't do much more than that. I have emphasized that our curios- ity is provoked when we perceive a problem that we believe we can solve. What is the question that will engage students and make them want to know the answer? One way to view schoolwork is as a series of answers. We want students to know Boyle's law, or three causes of the U.S. Civil War, or why Poe's raven kept saying, "Nevermore." Sometimes I think that we, as teachers, are so eager to get to the answers that we do not devote sufficient time to developing the question. But as the information in this chapter indicates, it's the question that piques people's interest. Being told an answer doesn't do anything for you. You may have noted that I could have organized this book around principles of cognitive psychology. Instead I orga- nized it around questions that I thought teachers would find interesting.
- The core idea presented in this chapter is that solving a problem gives people pleasure, but the problem must be easy enough to be solved yet difficult enough to take some mental effort. Finding this sweet spot of difficulty is not easy. Your experience in the classroom is your best guide--whatever works, do again; whatever doesn't, discard. But don't expect that you will really remember how well a lesson plan worked a year later. Whether a lesson goes brilliantly well or down in flames, it feels at the time that we'll never forget what happened; but the ravages of memory can surprise us, so write it down. Even if it's just a quick scratch on a sticky note, try to make a habit of record- ing your success in gauging the level of difficulty in the problems you pose for your students.

# 2 - How Can I Teach Students the Skills They Need When Standardized Tests Require Only Facts?

- Question: Much has been written about fact learning, most of it negative. The narrow-minded schoolmaster demanding that students parrot facts they do not understand has become a cliché of American education, although the stereotype is neither new nor exclusively American—Dickens used it in Hard Times, published in 1854.
- Answer: There is no doubt that having students memorize lists of dry facts is not enriching. It is also true (though less often appreciated) that trying to teach students skills such as analysis or synthesis in the absence of factual knowledge is impossible. Research from cognitive science has shown that the sorts of skills that teachers want for students—such as the ability to analyze and to think critically—require extensive factual knowledge. The cognitive prin- ciple that guides this chapter is: **Factual knowledge must precede skill.**
- It's easy to see why a teacher, parent, or student would protest that knowing the answer to a lot of these questions doesn't prove that one really knows science or history. We want our students to think, not simply to memorize. When someone shows evidence of thinking critically, we consider her smart and well educated. When someone spouts facts without context, we consider her boring and a show-off. That said, there are obvious cases in which everyone would agree that factual knowledge is necessary. When a speaker uses unfamiliar vocabulary, you may not understand what he means. For example, if a friend sent you an e-mail telling you she thought your daughter was dating a "yegg," you'd certainly want to know the definition of the word (Figure 1). Similarly, you may know all of the vocabulary
- The necessity of background knowledge for comprehension is pretty obvious, at least as I've described it so far. You could summarize this view by noting that to think is a transitive verb. You need something to think about.
- We've all known someone who talks that way (and we try to avoid him or her), but not many; most writers and speakers feel safe omitting some information. How do writers (and speakers) decide what to omit? It depends on whom they're writing for (or speaking to). Have a look at Figure 4. What would the woman pictured there say if someone asked her, "What are you doing?"
- If she were talking to a two-year-old she might say, "I'm typing on a computer." But that would be a ridiculous answer for an adult. Why? Because the typist should assume that the adult knows she's typing. A more appropriate response might be, "I'm filling out a form." Thus we calibrate our answers, providing more or less (or different) information depending on our judgment of what the other person knows, thereby deciding what we can safely leave out and what needs to be explained. *
- A number of studies have shown that people understand what they read much better if they already have some background knowledge about the subject. Part of the reason is chunking. A clever study on this point was conducted with junior high school students.? Half were good readers and half were poor readers, according to standard reading tests. The researchers asked the students to read a story that described half an inning of a baseball game. As they read, the students were periodically stopped and asked to show that they understood what was happening in the story by using a model of a baseball field and players. The interesting thing about this study was that some of the students knew a lot about baseball and some knew just a little.
- **I've listed four ways that background knowledge is important to reading comprehension: (1) it provides vocabulary; (2) it allows you to bridge logical gaps that writers leave; (3) it allows chunking, which increases room in working memory and thereby makes it easier to tie ideas together; and (4) it guides the interpretation of ambiguous sentences. There are in fact other ways that background knowledge helps reading, but these are some of the highlights.**
- It's worth noting that some observers believe that this phenomenon-that knowledge makes you a good reader—is a factor in the fourth-grade slump. **If you're unfamiliar with that term, it refers to the fact that students from underprivileged homes often read at grade level through the third grade, but then suddenly in the fourth grade they fall behind, and with each successive year they fall even farther behind. The interpretation is that reading instruction through third grade focuses mostly on decoding-figuring out how to sound out words using the printed symbols—so that's what reading tests emphasize.** By the time the fourth grade rolls around, most students are good decoders, so reading tests start to emphasize comprehension. As described here, comprehension depends on background knowledge, and that's where kids from privileged homes have an edge. They come to school with a bigger vocabulary and more knowledge about the world than underprivileged kids. And because knowing things makes it easier to learn new things (as described in the next section), the gap between privileged and underprivileged kids widens.

## Background Knowledge is Necessary for Cognitive Skills

- First, you should know that much of the time when we see someone apparently engaged in logical thinking, he or she is actually engaged in memory retrieval. As I described in Chapter One, memory is the cognitive process of first resort. When faced with a problem, you will first search for a solution in memory, and if you find one, you will very likely use it. Doing so is easy and fairly likely to be effective; you probably remember the solution to a problem because it worked the last time, not because it failed. To appreciate this effect, first try a problem for which you don't have relevant background knowledge, such as the one shown in Figure 6.*
- Here's an example. Do you have a friend who can walk into someone else's kitchen and rapidly produce a nice dinner from whatever food is around, usually to the astonishment of whoever's kitchen it is? When your friend looks in a cupboard, she doesn't see ingredients, she see recipes. She draws on extensive background knowledge about food and cooking. For example, have a
- **FIGURE 10: Scientists are good at "thinking like scientists," but doing so depends not just on knowing and practicing the thinking strategies, but also on having background knowledge that allows them to use the thinking strategies. This may be why a well-known geologist, H. H. Read, said, "The best geologist is the one who has seen the most rocks.**
- You might think this effect is really due to attention. If I'm a basketball fan, I'll enjoy reading about basketball and will pay close attention, whereas if I'm not a fan, reading about basketball will bore me. But other studies have actually created experts. The researchers had people learn either a lot or just a little about subjects that were new to them (for example, Broadway musicals). Then they had them read other, new facts about the subject, and they found that the "experts" (those who had earlier learned a lot of facts about the subject) learned new facts more quickly and easily than the "novices" (who had earlier learned just a few facts about the subject)."
- I have of course made up all of the numbers in the foregoing example, but we know that the basics are correct-the rich get richer. We also know where the riches lie. If you want to be exposed to new vocabulary and new ideas, the places to go are books, magazines, and newspapers. Television, video games, and the sorts of Internet content that students lean toward (for example, social networking sites, music sites, and the like) are for the most part unhelpful. Researchers have painstakingly analyzed the contents of the many ways that students can spend their leisure time. Books, newspapers, and magazines are singularly helpful in introducing new ideas and new vocabulary to students.
- As an alternative to the quotations in Table 2, I offer a Spanish proverb that emphasizes the importance of experience and, by inference, knowledge: Mas sabe El Diablo por viejo que por Diablo. Roughly translated:"The Devil is not wise because he's the Devil. The Devil is wise because he's old."
- For reading, students must know whatever information writers assume they know and hence leave out. The necessary knowledge will vary depending on what students read, but most observers would agree that a reasonable minimum target would be to read a daily newspaper and to read books written for the intelligent layman on serious topics such as science and politics. Using that criterion, we may still be distressed that much
- Our goal is not simply to have students know a lot of stuff—it's to have them know stuff in service of being able to think effectively. **As emphasized in this chapter, think- ing critically requires background knowledge. Critical thinking is not a set of proce- dures that can be practiced and perfected while divorced from background knowledge. Thus it makes sense to consider whether students have the necessary background knowledge to carry out a critical thinking task you might assign. For example, I once observed a teacher ask her fourth-grade class what they thought it would be like to live in a rain forest. Although the students had spent a couple of days talking about rain forests, they didn't have the background knowledge to give anything beyond rather shallow responses (such as "It would be rainy"). She asked the same question at the end of the unit, and the student's answers were much richer. One student imme- diately said she wouldn't want to live there because the poor soil and constant shade would mean she would probably have to include meat in her diet—and she was a vegetarian.**
- The effects of knowledge described in this chapter also highlight why reading is so important. Books expose children to more facts and to a broader vocabulary than virtually any other activity, and persuasive data indicate that people who read for pleasure enjoy cognitive benefits throughout their lifetime. I don't believe it is quite the case that any book is fine "as long as they're reading." Naturally, if a child has a history of resisting reading, I'd be happy if she picked up any book at all. But once she is over that hump, I'd start trying to nudge her toward books at the appropriate reading level. It's rather obvious that a student doesn't gain much from reading books several grades below her reading level. I'm all for reading for pleasure, but there are fun, fascinating books at every reading level, so why not encourage age-appropriate materials? It's just as obvious that a too difficult book is a bad idea. The student won't understand it and will just end up frustrated. The school librarian should be a tremen- dous resource and ally in helping children learn to love reading, and she is arguably the most important person in any school when it comes to reading.
- At the end of the last section I noted that a child who starts behind in terms of knowledge will fall even farther behind unless there is some intervention. There seems to be little doubt that this is a major factor in why some children fare poorly in school. Home environments vary a great deal. What sort of vocabulary do parents use? Do the parents ask the children questions and listen to the children's answers? Do they take their child to the museum or aquarium? Do they make books available to their chil- dren? Do the children observe their parents reading? All of these factors (and others) likely play a role in what children know on their first day of school. In other words, before a child meets her first teacher, she may be quite far behind the child sitting next to her in terms of how easy it is going to be for her to learn. Trying to level this playing field is a teacher's greatest challenge. There are no shortcuts and no alternatives to trying to increase the factual knowledge that the child has not picked up at home.
# 3 - Why Do Students Remember Everything That's on Television and Forget Everything I Say?

- How can the memory system know what you'll need to remember later? Your memory system lays its bets this way: if you think about something carefully, you'll probably have to think about it again, so it should be stored. Thus your memory is not a product of what you want to remember or what you try to remember; it's a product of what you think about. A teacher once told me that for a fourth-grade
- Let's start by considering why you fail to remember something. Suppose I said to you, "Can you summarize the last professional development seminar you attended?" Let's further suppose that you brightly answer, "Nope, I sure can't." Why don't you remember?
- A third possibility is that the information no longer resides in long-term memory- that it has been forgotten. I'm not going to discuss forgetting, but it's worth taking a moment to dispel a common myth. You sometimes hear that the mind records in exquisite detail everything that happens to you, like a video camera, but you just can't get at most of it—that is, memory failures are a problem of access. If you were given the right cue, the theory goes, anything that ever happened to you would be recoverable. For example, you may think you remember almost nothing of your childhood home, but when you revisit it the smell of the camellia blooms in the yard wipes away the years, and the memories that you thought were lost can be pulled out, like charms on a fine chain. Such experiences raise the possibility that any memory that you believe is lost can in principle be recovered again. Successful memory under hypnosis is often
- We all know that students won't learn if they aren't paying attention. What's more mysterious is why, when they are paying attention, they sometimes learn and sometimes don't. What else is needed besides attention? A reasonable guess is that we remember things that bring about some emotional reaction. Aren't you likely to remember really happy moments, such as a wedding, or really sad ones, such as hearing the news of the attacks on 9/11? You are, and in fact if you ask people to name their most vivid memories, they often relate events that probably had some emotional content, such as a first date or a birthday celebration (Figure 5).
- Here's another way to think about it. Suppose you are walking the halls of your school and you see a student muttering to himself in front of his open locker. You can't hear what he's saying, but you can tell from his tone that he's angry. There are several things you could focus on. You could think about the sound of the student's voice, you could focus on how he looks, or you could think about the meaning of the incident (why the student might be angry, whether you should speak to him, and so on). These thoughts will lead to different memories of the event the next day. If you thought only about the sound of the student's voice, the next day you'd probably remember that sound quite well but not his appearance. If you focused on visual details, then that's what you'd remember the next day, not what the student's voice sounded like. In the same way, if you think about the meaning of a penny but never about the visual details, you won't remember the visual details, even if they have been in front of your eyes ten thousand times.
- Whatever you think about, that's what you remember. Memory is the residue of thought. Once stated, this conclusion seems impossibly obvious. Indeed, it's a very sensible way to set up a memory system. Given that you can't store everything away, how should you pick what to store and what to drop? Your brain lays its bets this way: If you don't think about something very much, then you probably won't want to think about it again, so it need not be stored. If you do think about something, then it's likely that you'll want to think about it in the same way in the future. If I think about what the student looks like when I see him, then his appearance is probably what I'll want to know about when I think about that student later.
- want students to think about meaning. Ninety-five percent of what students learn in school concerns meaning, not what things look like or what they sound like. * Therefore, a teacher's goal should almost always be to get students to think about meaning. The second subtlety (again, obvious once it's made explicit) is that there can be differ- ent aspects of meaning for the same material. For example, the word piano has lots of meaning-based characteristics (Figure 7). You could think about the fact that it makes music, or about the fact that it's expensive, or that it's really heavy, or that it's made from fine-quality wood, and so on. In one of my all-time favorite experiments, the researchers led subjects to think of one or another characteristic of words by plac- ing them in sentences-for example, "The moving men lugged the PIANO up the fight of stairs" or "The professional played the PIANO with a lush, rich sound."s The subjects knew that they needed to remember only the word in capitals. Later, experimenters administered a memory test for the words, with some hints. For piano, the hint was either "something heavy" or "something that makes music." The results showed that the subjects' memories were really good if the hint matched the way they had thought about piano, but poor if it didn't. That is, if the subjects read the moving men version of the sentence, hearing the cue "something that makes music" didn't help them remember piano. So it's not even enough to say, "You should think about meaning." You have to think about the right aspect of meaning.
- If you read Chapter One, you can easily guess a common technique that I would not recommend for getting students to think about meaning: trying to make the subject matter relevant to the students' interests. I know that sounds odd, so let me elaborate. Trying to make the material relevant to students' interests doesn't work. As I noted in Chapter One, content is seldom the decisive factor in whether or not our inter- est is maintained. For example, I love cognitive psychology, so you might think, "Well, to get Willingham to pay attention to this math problem, we'll wrap it up in a cognitive psychology example." But Willingham is quite capable of being bored by cognitive psychology, as has been proved repeatedly at professional conferences I've attended. Another problem with trying to use content to engage students is that it's sometimes very difficult to do and the whole enterprise comes off as artificial. How would a math instructor make algebra relevant to my sixteen-year-old daughter? With a "real-world" example using cell phone minutes? I just finished pointing out that any material has different aspects of meaning. If the instructor used a math problem with cell phone minutes, isn't there some chance that my daughter would think about cell phones rather than about the problem?
- **That's my real point in presenting these different types of teachers. When we think of a good teacher, we tend to focus on personality and on the way the teacher presents himself or herself. But that's only half of good teaching. The jokes, the stories, and the warm manner all generate goodwill and get students to pay attention. But then how do we make sure they think about meaning? That is where the second property of being a good teacher comes in —organizing the ideas in a lesson plan in a coherent way so that students will understand and remember. Cognitive psychology cannot tell us how to be personable and likable to our students, but I can tell you about one set of principles that cognitive psychologists know about to help students think about the meaning of a lesson.**
- Before we can talk about how a story structure could apply to a classroom, we must go over what a story structure is. There is not universal agreement over what makes a story, but most sources point to the following four principles, often summarized as the four Cs. The first C is causality, which means that events are causally related to one another. For example, "I saw Jane; I left the house" is just a chronological telling of events. But if you read, "I saw Jane, my hopeless old love; I left the house," you would understand that the two events are linked causally. The second C is conflict. A story has a main character pursuing a goal, but he or she is unable to reach that goal. In Star Wars the main character is Luke Skywalker, and his goal is to deliver the stolen plans and help destroy the Death Star. Conflict occurs because there is an obstacle to the goal. If Luke didn't have a worthy adversary—Darth Vader—it would make for a rather short movie. In any story the protagonist must struggle to meet his goal. The third C is complications. If Luke simply hammered away for ninety minutes at his goal of delivering the plans, that would be rather dull. Complications are subproblems that arise from the main goal. Thus, if Luke wants to deliver the plans, he must first get off his home planet, Tatooine—but he has no transportation. That's a complication that leads to his meeting another major character, Han Solo, and leaving the planet amid a hail of gunfire—always a movie bonus. The final C is character. A good story is built around strong, interesting characters, and the key to those qualities is action. A skillful storyteller shows rather than tells the audience what a character is like. For example, the first time the Star Wars audience sees Princess Leia she is shooting at storm troop- ers. Hence we don't need to be told that she is brave and ready to take action.
## Attention Grabbers

- Another teacher once told me she wore a toga to class on the first day she began a unit on ancient Rome. I am sure that got her students' attention. I am also sure it ontinued to get their attention-that is, to distract them—once the teacher was ready for them to think about something else.
- Here's one more example. A guest in a biology class asked the students to think of the very first thing they had ever seen. The students mulled that question over and gener- ated such guesses as "the doctor who pulled me out," "Mom," and so forth. The guest then said, "Actually, the first thing each of you saw was the same. It was pinkish, diffuse light coming through your mother's belly. Today we're going to talk about how that first experience affected how your visual system developed, and how it continues to influence the way you see today." I love that example because it grabbed the students' attention and left them eager to hear more about the subject of the lesson.
- Now this doesn't mean that discovery learning should never be used, but it does sug- gest a principle for when to use it. Discovery learning is probably most useful when the environment gives prompt feedback about whether the student is thinking about a problem in the right way. One of the best examples of discovery learning is when kids learn to use a computer, whether they are learning an operating system, a com- plex game, or a Web application.
- As I've emphasized, structuring a lesson plan around conflict can be a real aid to student learning. Another feature I like is that, if you succeed, you are engaging students with the actual substance of the discipline. I've always been bothered by the advice "make it relevant to the students," for two reasons. First, it often feels to me that it doesn't apply. Is the Epic of Gilgamesh relevant to students in a way they can understand right now? Is trigonometry? Making these topics relevant to students' lives will be a strain, and students will probably think it's phony. Second, if I can't con- vince students that some material is relevant, does that mean I shouldn't teach it? If I'm continually trying to build bridges between students' daily lives and their school subjects, the students may get the message that school is always about them, whereas I think there is value, interest, and beauty in learning about things that don't have much to do with me. I'm not saying it never makes sense to talk about things students are interested in. What I'm suggesting is that student interests should not be the main driving force of lesson planning. Rather, they might be used as initial points of contact that help students understand the main ideas you want them to consider, rather than as the reason or motivation for them to consider these ideas.

# 4 - Why Is It So Hard for Students to Understand Abstract Ideas?

- Abstraction is the goal of schooling. The teacher wants students to be able to apply classroom learning in new contexts, including those outside of school. The challenge is that the mind does not care for abstractions. The mind prefers the concrete. That's why, when we encounter an abstract principle - for example, a law in physics such as, force = mass X acceleration-we ask for a concrete example to help us understand. The cognitive principle that guides this chapter is **We understand new things in the context of things we already know, and most of what we know is concrete.**
- FIGURE 1: "force = mass X acceleration" is difficult to understand because it is abstract. It's easier to understand with a concrete example. Use the same force (a man swinging a bat) to hit different masses-a baseball or an automobile. We understand that the acceleration of the ball and the acceleration of the car will be quite different.
- Now you see why I claim that understanding is remembering in disguise. No one can pour new ideas into a student's head directly. Every new idea must build on ideas that the student already knows. To get a student to understand, a teacher (or a par- ent or book or television program) must ensure that the right ideas from the student's long-term memory are pulled up and put into working memory. In addition, the right features of these memories must be attended to, that is, compared or combined or somehow manipulated. For me to help you understand the difference between ordinal and interval measurement, it's not enough for me to say, "Think of a thermometer and think of a horse race." Doing so will get those concepts into working memory, but I also have to make sure they are compared in the right way (Figure 2).
- The fear that students will end up with no more than rote knowledge has been almost a phobia in the United States, but the truth is that rote knowledge is probably relatively rare. Rote knowledge (as I'm using the term) means you have no understanding of the material. You've just memorized words, so it doesn't seem odd to you that Cavalier poets, best known for light lyrics of love and their romantic view of life, would have the philosophy "Cease the day!" (Figure 4). Much more common than rote knowledge is what I call shallow knowledge, mean- ing that students have some understanding of the mate- rial but their understanding is limited. We've said that students come to understand new ideas by relating them to old ideas. If their knowledge is shallow, the process stops
- **To Help Student Comprehension, Provide Examples and Ask Students to Compare Them**
	- Irony - In Oedipus Rex, the Delphic Oracle predicts that Oedipus will kill his father and marry his mother. Oedipus leaves his home in an effort to protect those he believes to be his parents, but thus sets in motion events that eventually make the prediction come true. In Romeo and Juliet, Romeo kills himself because he believes that Juliet is dead. When Juliet awakens, she is so distraught over Romeo's death that she commits suicide.

# 5 - Is Drilling Worth it?

- Answer: The bottleneck in our cognitive system is the extent to which we can juggle several ideas in our mind simultaneously. For example, it's easy to multiply 19 X 6 in your head, but nearly impossible to multiply 184,930 × 34,004. The processes are the same, but in the latter case you "run out of room" in your head to keep track of the numbers. The mind has a few tricks for working around this problem. One of the most effective is practice, because it reduces the amount of"room" that mental work requires. The cognitive principle that guides this chapter is **It is virtually impossible to become proficient at a mental task without extended practice. **
- Why practice? One reason is to gain a minimum level of competence. A child practices tying her shoelaces with a parent or teacher's help until she can reliably tie them without supervision. We also practice tasks that we can perform but that we'd like to improve. A professional tennis player can hit a serve into his opponent's court every time, but he nevertheless practices serving in an effort to improve the speed and placement of the ball. In an educational setting, both reasons—mastery and skill development-seem sensible. Students might practice long division until they master the process, that is, until they can reliably work long-division problems. Other skills, such as writing a persuasive essay, might be performed adequately, but even after students have the rudiments down, they should continue to practice the skill in an effort to refine and improve their abilities.
- and see whether their scores on each test tend to be the same. To a surprising degree, scoring well on a working-memory test predicts scoring well on a reasoning test, and a poor working-memory score predicts a poor reasoning score (although working memory is not everything— recall that in Chapter Two I emphasized the importance of background knowledge). Well, you're not going to get more working-memory capacity from a genie. And because this chapter is about practice, you might think I'm going to suggest that students do exercises that will improve their working memory. Sadly, such exercises don't exist. As far as anyone knows, working memory is more or less fixed—you get what you get, and practice does not change it.
- What used to take all of the room in working memory now takes almost no room. As an adult you can tie your shoes while holding a conversation or even while working math problems in your head (in the unlikely event that the need arises). Another standard example, as I've already mentioned, is driv- ing a car. When you fist learn to drive, doing so takes all of your working-memory capacity. As with tying your shoes, it's the stuff you're doing that takes up the mental space-— processes like checking the mirrors, monitoring how hard you're pressing the accelerator or brake to adjust your speed, looking at the speedometer, judging how close other cars are. Note that you're not trying to keep a lot of things (like letters) in mind simultaneously; when you do that, you can gain mental space by chunking. In this example, you're trying to do a lot of things in rapid succession. Of course, an experienced driver seems to have no problem in doing all of these things, and can even do other things, such as talk to a passenger.
- trying to do. Most of the time automatic processes help rather than hinder. They help because they make room in working memory. Processes that formerly occupied working memory now take up very little space, so there is space for other processes. In the case of reading, those "other" processes would include thinking about what the words actually mean. Beginning readers slowly and painstakingly sound out each letter and then combine the sounds into words, so there is no room left in working memory to think about meaning (Figure 4). The same thing can happen even to experienced readers. A high school teacher asked a friend of mine to read a poem out loud. When he had finished reading, she asked what he thought the poem meant. He looked blank for a moment and then admitted he had been so focused on reading without mistakes that he hadn't really noticed what the poem was about. Like a first grader, his mind had focused on word pronunciation, not on meaning. Predictably, the class laughed, but what happened was understandable, if unfortunate.
- Doing a lot of studying right before a test is commonly known as cramming. I remem- ber that when I was in school, students would brag that they had crammed for a test and done well but couldn't remember any of the material a week later. (An odd thing to brag about, I know.) Research bears out their boasts. If you pack lots of studying into a short period, you'll do okay on an immediate test, but you will forget the mate- rial quickly. If, on the other hand, you study in several sessions with delays between them, you may not do quite as well on the immediate test but, unlike the crammer, you'll remember the material longer after the test (Figure 7). The spacing effect probably does not surprise teachers all that much; certainly we all know that cramming doesn't lead to long-lasting memory. In contrast, then, it makes sense that spreading out your studying would be better for memory than cramming.
- I began this chapter by pointing out that there are two obvious reasons to practice: to gain minimum competence (as when a teenager practices driving with a manual shift until he can reliably use it) and to gain proficiency (as when a golfer practices putts to improve her accuracy). I then suggested a third reason to continue practicing mental skills, even when there are not obvious improvements in our abilities. Such practice yields three benefits: (1) it can help the mental process become automatic and thereby enable further learning; (2) it makes memory long lasting; and (3) it increases the likelihood that learning will transfer to new situations.

# 6 - What's the Secret to Getting Students to Think Like Real Scientists, Mathematicians, and Historians?

- This protest against school curricula has a surface plausibility: How can we expect to train the next generation of scientists if we are not training them to do what scientists actually do? But a flawed assumption underlies the logic, namely that students are cognitively capable of doing what scientists or historians do. The cognitive principle that guides this chapter is: **Cognition early in training is fundamentally different from cognition late in training.**
- These activities don't seem to give students any practice in what scientists actually do. For example, scientists don't know the outcome of an experiment before they do it-they do the experiment to find out what will happen, and they must interpret the results, which are often surprising or even self-contradictory. In fact, high schoolers know that laboratory exercises have predictable outcomes, so their focus is probably not on what the lab is meant to illustrate but more on whether they "did it right." Likewise, historians don't read and memorize textbooks-they work with original sources (birth certificates, diaries, contemporary newspaper accounts, and the like) to construct sensible narrative interpretations of historical events. If we're not giving students practice in doing the things that historians and scientists actually do, in what sense are we teaching them history and science?
- Real scientists are experts. They have worked at science for forty hours (likely many more) each week for years. It turns out that those years of practice make a qualitative, not quantitative, difference in the way they think compared to how a well-informed amateur thinks. Thinking like a historian, a scientist, or a mathematician turns out to be a very tall order indeed. I'll start this discussion by giving you a sense of what expert thinkers do and how they do it.
- House, like any other physician, is bombarded with information: data from his own examination, results from multiple laboratory tests, the facts of the medical history, and so forth. We normally think that having more information is good, but that's not really true—just think of your reaction when you use Google and get five million results. Medical students have a hard time separating the wheat from the chaff, but experi- enced doctors seem to have a sixth sense about what is important and what should be ignored. For example, House shows little concern for the patient's double vision. (He initially says, "get glasses.") He focuses his attention on the night terrors. Experience also makes House more sensitive to subtle cues that others miss; he alone notices the odd jerk in the boy's leg.
- Expertise extends even to the types of mistakes that are made. When experts fail, they do so gracefully. That is, when an expert doesn't get the right answer, the wrong answer is usually a pretty good guess. House is frequently wrong on his way to the correct diagnosis (the show would last just five minutes if he never made mistakes), but his guesses are portrayed as making sense, whereas the tentative assessments of his junior associates often do not. House will point out (usually with withering sarcasm) that an important symptom (or lack of symptom) makes the proposed diagnosis impossible.
- We can generalize by saying that experts think abstractly. Remember that in Chapter Four 1 said that people find abstract ideas hard to understand because they focus on the surface structure, not on the deep structure. Experts don't have trouble understanding abstract ideas, because they see the deep structure of problems. In a classic demonstration of this idea, physics novices (undergraduates who had taken one course) and physics experts (advanced graduate students and professors) were given twenty-four physics problems and asked to put them into categories.? The novices created categories based on the objects in the problems; problems using springs went into one category, problems using inclined planes went into another, and so on. The experts, in contrast, sorted the problems on the basis of the physical principles that were important to their solution; for example, all of the problems that relied on conservation of energy were put into the same group whether they used springs or planes (Figure 3).
- The second way to get around the limited size of working memory is to practice procedures so many times that they become automatic. That way the procedures don't take space in working memory. Tie your shoes a few hundred times and you no longer need to think about it; your fingers just fly through the routine without any direction from thought processes that would crowd working memory. Experts have automa- tized many of the routine, frequently used procedures that early in their training required careful thought. Expert bridge players can count the points in a hand without thinking about it. Expert surgeons can tie sutures automatically. Expert teachers have routines with which they begin and end class, call for attention, deal with typical disruptions, and so on. It's interesting to note that novice teachers often script their lessons, planning exactly what they will say. Expert teachers typically do not. They plan different ways that they will discuss or demonstrate a concept, but they don't write out scripts, which suggests that the process of translating abstract ideas into words that their students can understand has become automatic.
- There's nothing magical about a decade; it just seems to take that long to learn the background knowledge and to develop the automaticity that I've been talking about in this chapter. Indeed, it's been shown that those who have less time to practice take longer than a decade, and in fields where there is less to learn--short-distance sprint- ing or weightlifting, for example—-one can achieve greatness with only a few years of practice. In most fields, however, ten years is a good rule of thumb. And study and practice do not end once one achieves expert status. The work must continue if the status is to be maintained (Figure 7).
## Implications

- **Students Are Ready to Comprehend but Not tAo Create Knowledge.**  Thus, trying to get your students to think like them is not a realistic goal. Your reac- tion may well be, "Well, sure. I never really expected that my students are going to win the Nobel Prize! I just want them to understand some science." That's a worthy goal, and it is very different from the goal of students thinking like scientists. Drawing a distinction between knowledge under- standing and knowledge creation may help. Experts create. For example, scientists create and test theories of natural phenomena, historians create narrative interpretations of historical events, and mathematicians create proofs and descriptions of complex patterns. Experts not only understand their field, they also add new knowledge to it.
- But a teacher might have other reasons for asking students to do these things. For example, a teacher might ask her students to interpret the results of a laboratory experiment not with the expectation that she is teaching them to think like scientists but instead to highlight a particular phenomenon or to draw their attention to the need for close observation of an experiment's outcome.

# 7 - How Should I Adjust My Teaching for Different Types of Learners?

- **Children are more alike than different in terms of how they think and learn.**
- There Is Value in Every Child, Even If He or She Is Not "Smart in Some Way" I am willing to bet you have heard someone say, "Every student is intelligent in some way," or ask students to identify "What kind of smart are you?" I think teachers say this in an effort to communicate an egalitarian attitude to students: everyone is good at something. But there are a couple of reasons to be leery of this attitude. First, this sort of statement rubs me the wrong way because it implies that intelligence brings value. Every child is unique and valuable, whether or not they are intelligent or have much in the way of mental ability. I admit that being the father of a severely mentally retarded child probably makes me sensitive on this issue. My daughter is not intelligent in any sense of the word, but she is a joyful child who brings a lot of happiness to a lot of people.

# 8 - How Can I Help Slow Learners?

- **Children do differ in intelligence, but intelligence can be changed through sustained hard work.**
- Consider two hypothetical students. Felicia seems very concerned about whether she appears intelligent. When given a choice of tasks, she picks the easy one to be sure that she succeeds. When confronted with a challenging task, she quits after the first setback, usually protesting loudly that she is tired, or offering some other excuse. Molly, in contrast, doesn't seem bothered by failure. Given a choice, she picks tasks that are new to her and seems to enjoy learning from them, even if they are frustrating. When a task is difficult, Molly doesn't withdraw, she persists, trying a new strategy (Figure 7).
- You have doubtless had Mollys and Felicias in your classroom. What accounts for the differences between them? One important factor is what they believe about intel- ligence. Students like Felicia believe that intelligence is fixed, determined at birth; and because it's unchangeable, she's very concerned that she get the "right label," so she picks easy tasks. Felicia's beliefs about intelligence really paint her into a corner. She thinks that smart people don't need to work hard to succeed —they succeed through their superior intelligence. Therefore, working hard is a sign of being dumb. Thus, although it's very important to Felicia to appear smart, she won't allow herself to work hard to be sure she succeeds because she thinks hard work makes her look dumb!
- Therefore, she's not motivated to pick easy tasks; instead, she's more likely to pick challenging tasks, because she might learn from them. Molly also doesn't think that working hard is a sign of stupidity-on the contrary, she thinks hard work is a sign that one is trying to get smarter.
- It sounds like Molly is much more likely than Felicia to succeed in school, and there is good evidence that that's true. Students who believe that intelligence can be improved with hard work get higher grades than students who believe that intelligence is an immutable trait.
- What's especially interesting about this work is that it's concerned with praise. How can it be a bad idea to tell a student she's smart? By praising a child's intelligence, we let her know that she solved the problems correctly because she is smart, not because she worked hard. It is then a short step for the student to infer that getting problems wrong is a sign of being dumb.

## Implications for the Classroom

- **Praise Effort, Not Ability.** - This principle should be obvious from the research I've described. You want to encourage your students to think of their intelligence as under their control, and especially that they can develop their intelligence through hard work. Therefore, you should praise processes rather than ability. In addition to praising effort (if appropriate), you might praise a student for persistence in the face of challenges, or for taking responsibility for her work. Avoid insincere praise, however. Dishonest praise is actually destructive. If you tell a student, "Wow, you really worked hard on this project!" when the student knows good and well that she didn't, you lose credibility.
- **Tell Them That Hard Work Pays Off.** - Praising process rather than ability sends the unspoken message that intelligence is under the student's control. There is no reason not to make that message explicit as well, especially as children approach upper elementary school. Tell your students how hard famous scientists, inventors, authors, and other "geniuses" must work in order to be so smart; but even more important, make that lesson apply to the work your students do. If some students in your school brag about not studying, explode that myth; tell them that most students who do well in school work quite hard.
- Persuading students of that truth may not be easy. I once had a student who was on the football team and devoted a great deal of time to practice, with little time left over for academics. He attributed his poor grades to his being "a dumb jock." I had a conversation with him that went something like this: DTW: Is there a player on the team who has a lot of natural ability but who just doesn't work very hard, goofs off during practices, and that sort of thing?
- **Treat Failure As a Natural Part of Learning.** "Kid, the only people who don't make mistakes are the ones who never do anything." It was tremendously freeing— not because I avoided judgment for the incident, but it was the first time I really understood that you have to learn to accept failure if you're ever going to get things done. Michael Jordan put it this way: "I've missed more than nine thousand shots in my career. I've lost almost three hundred games. Twenty-six times I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed."
- **Don't Take Study Skills for Granted.** Make a list of all of the things you ask students to do at home. Consider which of these things have other tasks embedded in them and ask yourself whether the slower students really know how to do them. For older students, if you announce that there will be a quiz, you assume they will study for it. Do your slower students really know how to study? Do they know how to assess the importance of different things they've read and heard and seen? Do they know how long they ought to study for a quiz? (At the college level, my low-performing students frequently protest their low grades by telling me, "But I studied for three or four hours for this test!" I know that the high-scoring students study about twenty hours.) Do your slower students know some simple tricks to help with planning and organizing their time?
- All students must learn new skills as homework becomes more demanding skills of self-discipline, time management, and resourcefulness (for example, knowing what to do when they're stumped). Students who are already behind will have that much more trouble doing work on their own at home, and they may be slower to learn these skills. Don't take for granted that your slower students have these skills, even if they should have acquired them in previous grades.
- When a dieter makes a wrong choice or two, there is a tendency to feel like a failure, and then to give up the diet altogether. A great deal of research shows that the most successful diets are not diets. Rather, they are lifestyle changes that the person believes he could live with every day for years-for example, switching from regular milk to skim milk, or walking the dog instead of just letting her out in the morning, or drinking black coffee instead of lattes.
- **Show Students That You Have Confidence in Them.** Ask ten people you know, "Who was the most important teacher in your life?" I've asked dozens of people this question and have noticed two interesting things. First, most people have a ready answer. Second, the reason that one teacher made a strong impression is almost always emotional. The reasons are never things like "She taught me a lot of math." People say things like "She made me believe in myself" or "She taught me to love knowledge." In addition, people always tell me that their important teacher set high standards and believed that the student could meet those standards.

# 9 - What About My Mind?

- I have described to teachers how cognitive psychologists talk about working memory: they refer to it as a mental place where we juggle several things at once and where, if we try to juggle too many things, one or more things will be dropped. Teachers always respond in the same way: "Well of course! You've just described my work day." Formal experiments confirm this strong intuition; teaching is quite demanding of working memory.
- Until now, I have been a bit casual in how I have talked about practice. I have made it sound synonymous with experience. It is not. Experience means you are simply engaged in the activity. Practice means you are trying to improve your performance. For example, I'm not an especially good driver, even though I've been driving for about thirty years. Like most people my age I'm experienced— that is, I've done a lot of driving—but I'm not well practiced, because for almost all of that thirty years I didn't try to improve. I did work at my driving skills when I first got behind the wheel. After perhaps fifty hours of practice, I was driving with skill that seemed adequate to me, so I stopped trying to improve (Figure 2).
- FIGURE 3: Most of us treat Monopoly as a diversion, but serious players compete in tournaments and are highly skilled. That skill is developed through practice, and practice requires expert feedback. Ken Koury, pictured here, is a U.S. Monopoly player who has served as a coach at the national and international tournament levels.
- To summarize, if you want to be a better teacher, you can- not be satisfied simply to gain experience as the years pass. You must also practice, and practice means (1) consciously trying to improve, (2) seeking feedback on your teaching, and (3) undertaking activi- ties for the sake of improve- ment, even if they don't directly contribute to your job. There are lots of ways you could do these things, of course. Here I suggest one method.
- They should be concrete and about the behaviors you observe, not about qualities you infer. Thus, don't just say, "She really knows how to explain things"; instead say, "That third example really made the concept click for students." Rather than saying, "His classroom management is a mess," say, "I noticed that a lot of the students were having trouble listening when he asked them to sit down."
- Step 2: Tape Yourself and Watch the Tapes Alone There is a lot of value in videotaping your teaching. As I mentioned earlier, it's dif- ficult to watch your class while you're busy teaching it, but you can watch a video at your leisure, and you can replay important parts. If you don't own a video camera, you may be able to borrow one from your school. You might want to send a note home with students to let parents know that their child is being videotaped, that the tapes are purely for your professional development and will not be used for any other pur- pose, and that the tapes will be erased at the end of the school year. (You should check with your principal on this matter.)
- **Keep a Teaching Diary** Make notes that include what you intended to do and how you thought it went. Did the lesson basically work? If not, what are your thoughts as to why it didn't? Every so often take a little time to read past entries. Look for patterns in what sorts of lessons went well and which didn't, for situations that frustrated you, for moments of teaching that really keep you going, and so on.
- What makes students in the age group you teach tick? What motivates them, how do they talk to one another, what are their passions? You probably know your students pretty well in the classroom, but would your students say they are "themselves" when they are in your classroom? Would it be useful to you to see them acting in ways that are not contrived for the classroom or when they are surrounded by a different group of children?

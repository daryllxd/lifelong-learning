# How to Make Friends in a New City
[Reference](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-friends-in-a-new-city/)

- Keys to fostering friendship: proximity, repeated and unplanned interactions, and a setting that encourages vulnerability.
- Why it's harder to make friends after college: you have to be intentional about creating those environments that lend themselves to friendship. We also have to learn how to make plans and follow through, as those unplanned interactions from college will occur less and less.
- *If you can get emotional fulfillment from your family, you won't look for it as much elsewhere.* So there comes a point where we stop even trying to make friends and end up thinking we can be content interacting with only the people in our household.
- We become pickier and we set the bar incredibly high as to whether someone is worth trying to get to know better or not. (But if you think about it this way, your friends in college were probably people you wouldn't talk to for that long, but you spent a lot of time together anyway.)
- We gave up.
- Steps to make friends:
  - Stick to your neighborhood as best as you can.
  - Reconnect with old friends and acquaintances.
  - Make detailed plans.
  - Find a hobby and be open to meeting people while doing it.
  - "Hi, I'm new to the city."

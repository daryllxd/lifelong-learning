- Earplugs and face-mask for sleeping when in a noisy dorm room.
- Sheets are included usually but have a sleeper sheet just in case.
- Most hostels do not allow alcohol.
- Some hostels disallow access during certain times of the day for cleaning.
- Most hostels do not provide towels with their linens.
- Many hostels only take cash.
- Avoid leaving your passport as a deposit.
- When making reservations at hostels, if you cancel within 24 hours of scheduled check-in, they will probably charge you for that first night stay.
- Bring a padlock.
- Always wear sandals in the shower at hostels.
- Nearly all hostels have Wifi.
- Read reviews but don't go overboard.
- When locating a hostel, make sure to read the hostels write-up for directions.
- Get to know the hostel owner, they often know each other and they can give good tips on hostel choices in your next destination.
- The best hostel is the one you can walk to and from the bus/train station.
- Meet as many people as you can.
- Do not leave your shampoo in the shower.
- If you are leaving on an early train, pack the night before, then while people are sleeping.
- Watch for bedbugs!
- Do not leave your wallet in the pocket of your trousers laying next to your bed before you turn in for the night.
- Better to pick a bottom bunk, they are more accessible. But the top bunk is safer. If the bunk is up on a wall, it's harder for someone to get to them.
- To ensure happiness, be satisfied with the bare minimum. You are a traveller, not a tourist. Life is an adventure. :)
- Sleep with your wallet under your pillow.
- A lot of hotels offer a buffet style breakfast, you can probably get some bread and make a sandwich for later in the day.

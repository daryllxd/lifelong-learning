# Negotiation skills: Resolve Conflict

# Week 1

## 1.1 - Your skillset and the new world of work

- The Mind and Heart of the Negotiatior
    - A type of formal problem-solving - necessity would be over the renewal of the contract at the end of an initial term.
    - Negotiations of necessity - needed.
    - Negotiations of opportunity - optional.
- Wise and sustainable agreements - occur when we look closely at the issues and clearly identify the interests and speak assertively.
- **First challenge - be more tuned to negotiations of opportunity, to recognise one as it arises.**
- “Is that negotiable?”
- If you enjoy how you feel when you’re negotiating, then you are on the right path of becoming a people person, and potentially a great negotiator.
- Instead of complaining about bad service, maybe get a discount?

## 1.2 - Awareness and diagnosis

- “Win-win” can be a style of negotation, not just an outcome.
- In seeking a negotiated outcome or resolution to a conflict, you must probe/share the perspectives at a non-binding discussion.
- Investigation - analysis, planning, data collection
- Planning - take your and the other’s situation. What are their pressures? What’s their strategy? What are they going to ask for in return?
- Searching for alternative options
    - Solution - one only

## 1.3 - Becoming Proactive

- **Tacit agreement -**  the behavioral norms or rules that develop among two or more people in organization or a professional culture. These are often ambiguous and the least enforceable form of agreement.
    - Ex: onboarding someone, there are official rules, and there are unwritten rules.
- **Verbal agreements**
    - “Don’t you trust me?”
    - Perhaps the most infamous account of a handshake deal is that of Ray Kroc's handshake deal with the McDonald's brothers in the '60s. The handshake deal Kroc struck with the McDonald's brothers to pay a licensing fee, would have made the brothers millionaires and was apparently reneged on by Kroc, leaving the McDonald's with little to show for their brilliant idea.
- **Written agreement/binding**
    - Without an agreement in writing, the process of constructive confrontation at work can be quite difficult because the ambiguity provides for wiggle room.
    - In China, for example, where a contract must be written in Chinese and signed in accordance with Chinese law, not foreign law. Turning now from legal contracts to interpersonal conflicts and the agreements we forged to resolve them.
    - Hoover and DiSilvestro advocate for a type of workplace agreement they call a covenant. This approach requires parties to work towards a clear written agreement at the conclusion of high pressure dialogue or negotiation about performance or workplace behavior.

## 1.4 - Goals

- In negotiation, the goal is an actionable agreement around both substantive, and to a lesser degree intangible issues. While negotiations can be consuming in our working lives, the long periods of time and, of course, quite exhausting, normally they are to some extent separated from our identity. We don't make trades on our values, or on who we are.
- In contrast, conflict resolution is said to engage the whole person. People's lives can be totally consumed by conflicts, where their values clash with others, where critical matters of principle are in question, or where there are very high personal stakes at play.
    - Examples might be control of a family company's finances and its future strategy, custody of children, environmental protection, and so on.
    - Often in such high-stake situation, people find it very hard to bargain. They cannot imagine themselves conceding on any but the most minor of points, while on crucial issues, they feel they cannot give an inch in case they compromise on tightly held values and on issues to do with their identity.
    - Conflict resolution forces people to examine and re-evaluate their relationships to a much greater extent than negotiation.

# Week 2

- Think about a real conflict that you’ve experienced in the past few years.
    - Not passing probation in previous company - I remember intense feelings because I feel that I was judged unfairly, but I also deserved some part of it.
    - Will the conflict be all-consuming, or will it be viewed as normal?

## 2.1 - Why is conflict different?

- Social conflict - interpersonal and intergroup dynamics.
- Simmel, Lewin, Coser, Deutsch. Conflict (a threat from a group of outsiders) is thought to cement a group’s formation, cohesion, identity.
    - Coser added that conflict serves a range of social functions, generating norms, reinforcing institutions and sparking innovation.
    - While Lewin connected the denial of human needs with human conflict that need satisfaction is a source of human tension.
    - Deutsch added further, that we need not eliminate or prevent conflict, rather that we need to find ways to channel conflict towards constructive processes of resolution. Which led him to distinguish between constructive conflict and destructive conflict.
- This distinction prompted the field to frame the mixed motive perspective, which explores the interplay between cooperation and competition in social relationships. Humans are simultaneously motivated to compete with those they interact with around contested ground.
- Task-based conflict is constructive for groups, it stimulates creativity to bring innovation and better decisions. Whereas, relationship based conflict is typically destructive for interpersonal, intragroup, and intergroup conflict.
- One way that we see that happening in organisations and in communities is through the institutionalisation of what are called dispute resolution mechanisms.
- Nine universal needs
    - Consistency in response
    - Security
    - Recognition
    - Stimulation
    - Distributive justice
    - Appearance of rationality
    - Meaning
    - Control
    - Role defense
- As the great educational theorist John Dewey says, conflict is the gadfly of thought. It stirs us to observation and memory, it instigates invention. It shocks us out of shape, like passivity, and sets us at noting and contriving.

## 2.2 - Types of conflict relationships

- **Task-conflict** centers around how work gets done, priorities, resource allocation, procedures and policies, expectations, and other issues. This type seems relatively easy to resolve. These conflicts can however, be surface manifestations of a serious underlying conflict between coworkers, such as around territoriality or professional rivalry.
- **Relationship conflict** at work may arise from issues around personality, approaches to work, managing styles, conflict styles. When unaddressed relationship conflict can escalate, snowball and spiral out of control.
- The biggest challenge to finding a way to transform our relationship conflict into a task conflict. By asking these questions. Can you identify common goals or shared enemies? Are there shared connections between the people? Are there shared acquaintances? Can you create a shared vision by focusing on the future?
- **Values conflict - T**hese are the most difficult to resolve because they involve asking you or expecting you to act contrary to your own values or to support values that are contrary to your own, or perhaps even to abstain from acting on your own values.
    - Issues that go to the heart of an individual's identity and an organization's core values are difficult to resolve.

### Sources of Conflict

- Data - Data conflicts arise when there is information asymmetry. When one party holds more information and uses that as a source to increase their power over another.
- Structure - Is the free flow of information constrained? Is the allocation of resources confusing? Is the source of authority in decision-making unclear? Why don't just change the structure? /

## 2.3 - When things go wrong

- Situatlonal awareness/process diagnosis.
- Breakdown of trust is why negotiations break down and fail.
- Identification-based trust - we trust our counterparts because we identify with them.
- Knowledge-based trust - because we know them, like long-term colleagues.
- Deterrence-based trust - they fear the consequences if trust is breached.
- **Emotional bank account (Stephen Covey).**
- Breakdowns:
    - Biased positions or biased mindset.
    - Perception tests - when you are presented the same set of facts, people see and hear different things.
    - Intransigents or inflexibility. Ask how to explain why.
    - Loss of face/embarrassment due to a loss of status.

## 3 Types of Conflict and How to Address Them

- Task conflict - how to divide up resources.
- Relationship conflict - differences in personality, style, taste.
- Value conflict - identities and values.

## [Wheel of Conflict](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/beyond-words/201204/the-wheel-conflict)

- Structure: Consider how the dynamics of the participants(boss/employee) are creating or contributing to the conflict. Additionally, other structure elements can include time (not enough) or unequal access or control of resources.
- Emotions: Do not ignore your emotions or others, however when out of control, emotions can easily create disputes and conflicts.
- History: The relationship and past experiences between two people involved in a conflict/dispute can lead to people making assumptions about the other developing a negative [bias](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/basics/bias) prior to even engaging the person.
- Communication: Consider the choice of words used, how they are said and the many nonverbal communication elements and cues. Positive statements with incongruent body language often lead people to believing the nonverbal communication is more truthful (read more about this [here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/beyond-words/201109/is-nonverbal-communication-numbers-game)). For example, if you say you care about hearing their opinion while reclining in your chair and not making eye contact with your arms crossed over your chest will nonverbally show disinterest.
- Values: Different people have different wants, needs, and [goals](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/basics/motivation) (working late to make overtime compared to wanting to go home on time). Assuming others, even from a perspective of thinking it is a positive offer or collaborative approach, could lead to a negative response if your values, ideology, or beliefs differ.

## [Dare to disagree](https://www.ted.com/talks/margaret_heffernan_dare_to_disagree)

# Week 3 - Building and Using a Skillset

## 3.1: Orienting: Past, present, future

- All of us naturally develop distinctive conflict and negotiation styles that reflect our preferred way of resolving a conflict.
- The five conflict strategies we're exploring are based on Blake and Mouton's managerial grid, which you might recall from the adapt your leadership style course. With this matrix as a catalyst, Thomas and Kilmann, Rahim, Johnson, Pruitt and Carnevale and others contributed to a model of conflict strategies using two measures, asserting along the y-axis and accommodating along the x-axis.
- Conflict avoidance is problematic because while individuals who have a strong conflict avoidance style appear to be agreeable, easygoing, even popular on the surface, underneath, they can build up a lot of frustration and resentment because they're unlikely to challenge the status quo.
    - Conflict avoiders rationalize their inaction or indirect approach to difficult situations and accept what others are prepared to let them have.
- In contrast, those with a very competitive conflict style, are more likely to display highly assertive conflict behaviors. When their perceived needs or interests are being challenged by others, they assert themselves strongly. The challenge for people with a strong competing style is to refrain from becoming domineering and argumentative, seeing conflict at every turn. They might find it difficult to collaborate or even offer concessions to others.
    - They may also find people are turned off, choose to disengage or actively find alternative ways of working to avoid a person that they feel always has to win or always has to have the last word. To adapt your conflict style to suit the situation, you need to learn to bring some new behaviors into your repertoire.
- Reflection is key. It takes intentional practice to consider alternatives to how you would normally react or how you would behave. A successful process incorporates reflective journal writing and discussions with a peer or mentor.
- You'll be asking questions like, what happened? How did I react or how did I behave? What was the consequence of my response? How did I feel afterwards? What happened in that relationship next or after the event? What alternative responses were available, and did I consider them? Would those alternatives have had a different or a better effect on the situation?
- Leading in the new world of work requires people who are self-aware and who can adapt their style to different situations, unclear rules, different people and new, more complex organizational forms.

## 3.2 Toolkit: Sharpen your skills

- What's the most important skill in negotiation? Being able to quickly figure out what's going on in the room. To quickly evaluate proposals, ideas, and options to overcome problems, and being sharp enough to review the proposal or idea quickly and then respond.
- When you are situationally aware, you're a sense-maker. A sense-maker connects the dots, constructs a coherent picture of what's going on, and most importantly, identifies relationships among items rather than viewing elements in isolation. You watch, you listen, you know how to respond in ways that make people feel comfortable, heard, and understood.
- Being empathetic is not risky, it's not a show of weakness or validation of your counterpart's argument, as some may claim. There is in fact a distinction between empathizing and agreeing, which you can see here in the second component of awareness.
- The second part of awareness is commonly known as reading the room. Emotional intelligence scholars call this the ability to recognize emotions in others, tuning into others' feelings and recognizing their unspoken messages.
- **It's very easy for you to learn the difference between open-ended questions and close-ended questions. What really matters is when you might use each to best effect. So I'm going to ask you the question, can you use the right type of question at the right time to the right person in the right tone, and respond to their answer in the right way?**
- This ability separates the master negotiator from the novice. There are, however, three types of questions that are not ideal in negotiation situations.
    - Number one is rhetorical questions, like what makes you think your property's worth so much?
    - Number 2 is leading questions, so don't you think it would be a good idea to invest something for the future now, rather than later?
    - And also double-barrelled questions, which involves peppering your counterpart with multiple questions one after the other, almost like a police interrogator. You're not sure which question to answer.
- When you're summarizing, I often think it's a good idea to use the second-person singular you. So you're saying that you're okay, with the way we've structured the deal, but the timing is problematic, is that, right? The use of the word you conveys ownership, and that alerts the speaker, on hearing it, that they've been quoted, and that they may need to correct or clarify their point.
    - In contrast, if you want to be assertive, I suggest you use the first-person singular I. I want to be clear, I'm not comfortable with this arrangement. And even though it may mean more work for the business, I don't agree to the deal structure as it sits. I'd like to suggest some modest changes that will make me more comfortable before proceeding. The I in this sentence softens the message, and makes it clear to the listener that I'm calmly asserting my interests and needs.
- Reframing is essentially taking a sent message and paraphrasing it, making subtle changes to the wording. These interventions can subtly de-escalate the situation and create opportunities for understanding, acceptance, and progress.
- **What I was doing was pacing out your objections. By anticipating that some of you would dismiss these skills, I wanted to direct your attention before delivering the message, rather than have you sit there and tolerate it.** Directing responses is an exercise in persuasion and influence, one that also aims to keep you interested right through to the end. So now you are armed with some new perspectives on six communication skills. I hope you enjoy practicing those skills, and that you experience some of the positive impact these skills can have on your most important conversations. [SOUND]

## 3.3 Goal setting: Maximising vs satisficing

- The two types are maximisers and satisficers. Which one are you? Michael Wheeler has a quick diagnostic you can do.
- When you go to a restaurant, how do you order a meal? Do you scrutinize the menu from top to bottom? Maximisers are typically those from the competitive conflict style. They maximize individual outcomes. Feel indecisive and worry about the point at which the deal is done. Maximisers appear to never be happy with the negotiation outcome. Some call this behavior the winner's curse.
- Or do you take a quick glance at the offerings?  As they're always hoping for a little bit more. If you win too easily, you regret not setting a higher starting price. Satisficers is the opposite. They settle too quickly. If they achieve the goal, they set, they are happy to agree, and don't ruminate over the outcome that was achieved.
- For instance, maximisers tend to lend jobs that pay more than satisficers, but they're less happy with their deal and complain. While the satisficers are content. It appears then, that the qualities of maximisers are used for cheering negotiation as they're more willing to question arbitrary deadlines or restrictive policies, drill down into contrived objections that are thrown up by their counterparts and breakdown resistance. The problem is that after the deal is done, the maximiser becomes restless and regretful. It's better to be a satificer, content with what's been achieved and ready to move on.
- It's a little unrealistic to think that you can switch from being a maximiser during a negotiation to satisficer after the deal is done. Since this is infeasible, one approach is to think about your process of goal setting in negotiation and reflect on the type of goals that you set.
- Do you tend to be more of a maximiser or a satisficer?
    - If you're still unsure from Wheeler's restaurant reflection exercise, then you can take an online test for this characteristic, which you'll find linked to this video. Then you can reflect on certain aspects of your behavior.
    - Now we're going to examine your behavior in a negotiation. Do you set absolute or relative goals? For instance, imagine you're at an auction for house that you're excited to buy? The first question is, do you set an upper limit and stick to it no matter what? Or do you aim to do better than the other bidders no matter what? If you answered yes to question 1, then you set absolute goals. Setting an absolute goal gives you a clear milestone and a measure of your success in that negotiation. This also makes it easier for you to reconcile yourself to the outcome. If you answered yes to question 2, then you set relative goals. Setting a relative goal can make you fall into the trap of competing with your counterparts, rather than focusing on your needs, your interests, and what the real goal in negotiation should be, which ultimately is to create value.
    - Before we draw to a close, I want you to think back to what you discovered this week about your conflict style profile, your confidence with the skills in your kit bag, and your goal setting tendencies. Ask yourself these three questions. What are your strengths? Where do you want to direct your intentional practice? Finally, what behavioral modifications do you want to make?

# Week 4: The Three Negotiations

- The **HOW** of the negotiation.

## 4.1 **Interests and trade-offs: Content vs process**

- 3 elements of negotiation
    - Relationship
    - Process
    - Substance
- **"If you believe that negotiations are only about the substantive issues, sadly, you will be right more than you are persuasive." That means that the truth, the facts, are only one argument in a negotiation. The people and the process are much more important. This is particularly hard for people who are focused on the substance, experts like doctors, engineers, financial experts to accept. A colleague of mine, Philippon says that, "One of the most common patterns in dysfunctional negotiations is where the parties focus on their respective content demands while ignoring or neglecting the process and the relationship.”**
- Identifying the type of relationship you're in, determines how you'll negotiate. Kelly Riordan says that there are three so-called moves people can make when sitting across from their counterparts at the negotiating table.
- These are illustrative of the type of relationship people are in.
    - People who constantly assert themselves, placing themselves above others, are said to be mostly using what are called one up moves.
    - While in contrast, those who constantly defer to others using phrases such as, I may be wrong or you probably right, are using what she calls one down-moves.
    - One across moves are also possible. These are more neutral and include comments like that's interesting [inaudible] which can break an unhelpful pattern between the parties.
- Riordan describes the one up position as being visible in the language that we observe.
    - People also use an up position when they're late for a meeting and don't think to apologize or by shaking hands in a dominant way, or being distracted or taking a call in the middle of a meeting.
    - According to Riordan, if both parties are constantly taking the one up position, it will be a very competitive conversation. Whereas if both are taking the one down position, it will be a conversation when little is accomplished.
    - Taking a one down position in a relationship, using moves such as deferring to others expertise, status, age, or position can at times be quite a clever strategy.
    - Especially if you anticipate that a counterpart is likely to pull rank on you, or if they're very sensitive to status issues.
- What does this look like in real life? Fisher and Shapiro have a great example. George and his editors have been hired to help a distinguished but arrogant professor at a famous Ivy League university write popular op-ed articles to promote the work of his department. George wants to start the meeting positively by showing his respect and establishing his own credibility. He says, ''It's a pleasure to be working with you. I feel that we each have something of value to enhance our collaboration. You have expertise in economics. You are the leader in your field. My expertise is having a good sense of what the average leader of an "op-ed" will understand.'' George is not just a great editor, is also a skilled negotiator. He defers to the professor on economics and at the same time establishes his own credibility as a skilled writer and editor. Smart. So while it may appear that George is making a one down-move and thereby establishing a relationship where he's dependent on the economics professor. In actual effect, he establishes an interdependent relationship.
- There's wisdom in knowing when to use a one down-move in order to get what you want.
    - Report is also critical in building and sustaining relationships by simply showing genuine interest in your counterpart, how they appear on a particular day, for example.
    - Observing their situation, recognizing and empathizing with them, finding a shared interest or perhaps a mutual acquaintance.
    - You can make a significant difference to their disposition and have a likely to treat you. The challenge lies in finding a key to unlock and more constructive and collaborative sides of people's personalities.
    - Often this small talk unlocks insights into your counterpart. While some people resist being drawn into small talk, even at a reasonably formal level, it's a widely-held convention and plays a far more important role in establishing the preconditions that influence and agreement and some people would carry with me.
- Do we really negotiate the process of negotiation you might ask? Yes of course, we do. Think about the raft of different process dimensions. They are frequently up for discussion and debate.
    - For example, who will be at the negotiation?
    - Who a legitimate stakeholder to the agreement? How will their interests be represented at the table?
    - How and where will the negotiation be conducted?
    - One of the protocols or rules will follow in the negotiation.
    - Will the agreement be binding?
    - What is the order in which the issues will be discussed?
    - What is on the agenda and off the agenda?
    - How will the information be presented?
    - They may be predetermined protocols or rules governing institutions that address some of these issues, such as court and ex-mediation for example. Other times, however, many of these rules are negotiated by the parties themselves.
- ''You're the preferred supplier, following the tender process but you're also the most expensive. If you can drop your price, I can justify appointing you. Then we can build a great relationship and there will be a lot of new opportunities for you in my organization.'' What do you do now?
    - Do you trust your friend? Drop your price and hope for the promise work to come through? Say you do it, a lower right now, for a promise of increased volume later. Promised work is not guaranteed. It's a vague promise. You've given a wholesale price for a retail volumes sale. As you can begin to see from this example, the fear is that if you can see it on your own interests, you'll only have the relationship. So when you trade between substance and relationship, ensure that you don't sit up a one-way relationship that puts you at the mercy of your customer.

## 4.2 Becoming a Facilitator: Process skills

- The opening statement to open up or begin a problem-solving process should positively influence your counterpart or provide context or direction to the group you are leading. An opening statement also serves to frame the interaction.
- The skill of framing, if you'll recall from previous lessons, involves priming the listener to receive the message in a certain light. In so doing, you might seek to influence the listener's emotions, for example, to relax them or conversely, to stimulate a sense of urgency or responsibility. Instead of just running through a dot point list of proposed agenda items, try to maximize the opportunity that a powerful opening presents with these five steps. Recap or summarize the previous meetings or the progress made. You can briefly mention the context for the negotiation. That might includes trends in the industry, societal trends, values, collective responsibility or the business opportunity.
- Next you can set the rules for the engagement. These are the communication rules around things like note-taking, timing, and goals for the day.
- Next you can set the agenda, that is, you propose the key issues that you think need to be discussed or agreed.
- Finally you highlight the future benefits that might be available if an agreement can be found. [MUSIC]
- As a facilitator in negotiation, you need to encourage the active involvement from all the participants. This is achieved when all parties are engaged, that is, they're sharing perspectives and their interests related to the problem or the opportunity being discussed. This leads to better informed options and stronger ownership of the agreement by members of the group. The success or failure of negotiations is often judged on their perceived fairness. By this we mean that when participants reflect or debrief on the process, they accept that they may not have achieved all their goals, but they feel that the decision was reached transparently and fairly. **During negotiations, process leaders often need to apply techniques to control those infected with motor mouth syndrome, and to temper their own tendency to overwhelm or dominate the discuddssion.**
- As a facilitator, you may need to manage the input of all parties, including the dominant leader. You can use a number of strategies to cut off dominant individuals and they include, breaking eye contact with them, using minimal interruptions to create punctuation points, for example, okay, yeah, I've got you, I understand by matching the person's pace so that you can retake control, but not matching the intensity of their voice.
- A key skill you'll need to learn to manage difficult or emotional conversations is to track both content and process. This allows you to tap into the emotions of your counterparts.
    - Patterson and his co-authors of the well-known book, Crucial Conversations, call this watching for content and conditions. It is a form of joule processing. When the stakes and emotions are high, we're focusing in on what we're saying, and it can be, "Next to impossible to pull ourselves out of the argument in order to see what's happening to ourselves and others."
- In order to do so, Patterson and co propose a four-step process called **Learning to Look**, and this can then help you to respond in anticipation of enduring a crucial conversation.
    - The four steps are: one, learn to look for both content and conditions for when things become crucial.
    - Two, learn to look for safety problems and this might come from changes in your own behavior, like feeling more emotion in yourself or sensing it in others.
    - Three, learn to look to see if others are moving to what they call silence or violence.
    - Finally, learn to look out for your own unhelpful behaviors, your so-called style under stress.
- We've already discussed a number of different process skills that can be used whether you're a direct participant in a negotiation or conflict resolution meeting, or when you are acting as a third party or facilitator.
    - If you foster level of transparency in your process management, you can lead a conversation out of trouble. To do so, clearly and calmly explain your suggestion, your redirection or a proposed alternate step.
    - That might mean deferring a question or a related process move, as in these two examples, "It looks like we've reached a certain level of agreement on timing. If we're all okay with what's been discussed so far, may I suggest we move to the next topic? If we discover there are some other elements that have a bearing on the timing, then let's revisit it. Would that be okay with everyone?", or "I'm getting a sense we're not making the same progress that we did yesterday.
    - Something seems to have started out on the wrong foot, do you agree? How about we have a short break for coffee and see if that helps us refocus and regain some of the momentum we built yesterday?" If made confidently and transparently, these kinds of process moves can help you avert a potential crisis, a tactical error, or save an otherwise productive conversation from breaking down. There you have it. Think about process as a negotiation within a negotiation. Using this approach, I think you'll enjoy more efficient negotiations and improved outcomes.

## 4.3 Structure: Proposing a process

- Example
    - Number 1, opening statements. Here, the meaning is framed by one or both of the parties.
    - Number 2, each party is asked to comment or offer some reflections, updates, or objectives. This establishes the norm of involvement.
    - Number 3, the interests of the parties are uncovered, encouraging the free flow of information, perspectives, and ideas.
    - Number 4, initial proposals are put forth in the form of options. At this stage, interests are clarified and counter-offers are also often made that will ideally build on the initial offers.
    - Number 5, common ground is identified and acknowledged. Areas of agreement are identified and differences explored.
    - Number 6 is the bargaining stage. Here, trades are offered and concessions are requested, denied, or agreed.
    - Number 7 is the agreement stage. This is where the parties finalize and formalize the agreement.
    - Number 8, the implementation stage, where the agreement is put into practice.
    - Number 9 is the review stage where the parties review and adjust as might be necessary.
- Mediation and other forms of dispute resolution follow a similar structure, and this is sometimes called the mediation diamond. It's so-called because the process follows a divergent/convergent structure. Where a narrow definition of a dispute is widened to cover a wider set of relational issues, or to allow perceptions to be shared about the precipitating events that lead to the conflict needing to be mediated.
- Once an agreement is settled, negotiators or disputants will have to return to their home environment to sell the agreement to the body of people they represent. Often called their constituents.
    - This body however, was not privy to the details, the subtleties of the negotiation process. They don't know for example, why concessions were made. This is what Oetzel and Ting-Toomey call, the re-entry problem. As a negotiator, you will have deeper insights from the negotiation process and possibly even empathy for your counterparts. When you share these perspectives in the home environment, however, you run the risk of looking like a sell-out.
- The most widely cited example of this from history was during the era of arms control between the USSR and the USA. The SALT II Treaty was negotiated over much of the 1970s and signed by Leonid Brezhnev and Jimmy Carter in 1979. But it never came into law in the United States because it wasn't ratified by the US Senate. Carter himself asked the Senate not to sign in retaliation for the Soviet's invasion of Afghanistan. Similar problems are faced by union negotiators, peacemakers in wartime, and those seeking to avoid war through negotiation, who are often labeled as appeasers.
- When you're negotiating on behalf of a group, even your family, remember that the re-entry problem is a difficult one for all negotiators. To combat this, negotiators are advised to do two things.
    - The first is to map your stakeholders.
    - The second, to identify who will support your efforts to socialize and normalize the agreement in your home environment. We now come to the end of this video about structuring negotiation and dispute resolution.
- You've learned about two core templates for negotiation and alternative dispute resolution. You've learned that sometimes you need to be prepared to deviate from a strict process template and go with the flow a little. Importantly, you now have a clear process structure in your mind for how to set up and then direct a problem-solving process. I hope adding a little structure to your negotiation helps you get a more efficient and perhaps better agreement the next time you negotiate.

## [**Top 10 Negotiation Skills You Must Learn to Succeed**](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/top-10-negotiation-skills/)

**1. Analyze and cultivate your BATNA.** In both integrative negotiation and [adversarial bargaining](http://www.pon.harvard.edu/tag/adversarial-bargaining/), your best source of power is your ability and willingness to walk away and take another deal. Before arriving at the bargaining table, wise negotiators spend significant time identifying their best alternative to a negotiated agreement, or BATNA, and taking steps to improve it.

**2. Negotiate the process.** Don’t assume you’re both on the same page when it comes to determining when to meet, who should be present, what your agenda will be, and so on. Instead, carefully negotiate how you will negotiate in advance. Discussing such procedural issues will clear the way for much more focused talks.

**3. Build rapport.** Although it’s not always feasible to engage in small talk at the start of a negotiation (particularly if you’re on a tight deadline), doing so can bring real benefits, research shows. You and your counterpart may be more collaborative and likely to reach an agreement if you spend even just a few minutes trying to get to know each other. If you’re negotiating over email, even a brief introductory phone call may make a difference. This is one of the most valuable negotiation skills to master.

**4. Listen actively.** Once you start discussing substance, resist the common urge to think about what you’re going to say next while your counterpart is talking. Instead, listen carefully to her arguments, then paraphrase what you believe she said to check your understanding. Acknowledge any difficult feelings, like frustration, behind the message. Not only are you likely to acquire valuable information, but the other party may mimic your exemplary listening skills.

**5. Ask good questions.** You can gain more in integrative negotiation by asking lots of questions—ones that are likely to get helpful answers. Avoid asking “yes or no” questions and leading questions, such as “Don’t you think that’s a great idea?” Instead, craft neutral questions that encourage detailed responses, such as “Can you tell me about the challenges you’re facing this quarter?”

**6. Search for smart tradeoffs.** In a distributive negotiation, parties are often stuck making concessions and demands on a single issue, such as price. In integrative negotiation, you can capitalize on the presence of multiple issues to get both sides more of what they want. Specifically, try to identify issues that your counterpart cares deeply about that you value less. Then propose making a concession on that issue in exchange for a concession from her on an issue you value highly.

**7. Be aware of the anchoring bias.** Ample research shows that the first number mentioned in a negotiation, however arbitrary, exerts a powerful influence on the negotiation that follows. You can avoid being the next victim of the [anchoring bias](http://www.pon.harvard.edu/tag/anchoring-bias/) by making the first offer (or offers) and trying to anchor talks in your preferred direction. If the other side does anchor first, keep your aspirations and BATNA at the forefront of your mind, pausing to revisit them as needed.

**8. Present multiple equivalent offers simultaneously (MESOs).** Rather than making one offer at a time, consider presenting several offers at once. If your counterpart rejects all of them, ask him to tell you which one he liked best and why. Then work on your own to improve the offer, or try to brainstorm with the other party an option that pleases you both. This strategy of presenting multiple offers simultaneously decreases the odds of impasse and can promote more creative solutions.

**9. Try a contingent contract.** Negotiators often get stuck because they disagree about how a certain scenario will play out over time. In such cases, try proposing a contingent contract—in essence, a bet about how future events will unfold. For example, if you doubt a contractor’s claims that he can finish your home renovation project in three months, propose a contingent contract that will penalize him for late completion and/or reward him for early completion. If he truly believes his claims, he should have no problem accepting such terms.

**10. Plan for the implementation stage.** Another way to improve the long-term durability of your contract is to place milestones and deadlines in your contract to ensure that commitments are being met. You might also agree, in writing, to meet at regular intervals throughout the life of the contract to check in and, if necessary, renegotiate. In addition, adding a dispute-resolution clause that calls for the use of [mediation](http://www.pon.harvard.edu/tag/mediation/) or [arbitration](http://www.pon.harvard.edu/tag/arbitration/) if a conflict arises can be a wise move.

# Week 5: When context matters: negotiating across a cultural divide

## Reading: Defining Culture

### National Culture

Geert Hofstede’s model of national cultures is without question the most influential framework used to describe and compare cultures. After various iterations, Hofstede has defined six variables on which national cultures can be compared.

1. Power distance
2. Uncertainty avoidance
    1. Uncertainty avoidance has to do with the way that a culture deals with the future and how comfortable people from such cultures are with ambiguity.
3. Femininity vs. masculinity
    1. In masculine cultures, where men play a dominant role and patriarchal traditions and rules are accepted, traits and values strongly associated with traditional notions of masculinity: competitiveness, achievement, success are displayed
    2. In contrast, feminine cultures are ones where the emphasis is placed more on quality of life, work life balance, harmony, inclusion and less competitive interactions in society.
4. Individualism vs. collectivism
5. Long-term vs. short-term (Confucianism) orientation

### Ethnic culture

When using this term we are describing groups of people who may share a common ancestry, religion, language, values, traditions, though they may, in fact, live in different countries, forming part of what is commonly referred to as a ‘diaspora’ a dispersed group of people - the Indian or Chinese diaspora for example. In such cases people may have the same or similar ethnicity but live in different countries.

### #3 Corporate culture

Schein’s model defined three levels of culture:

1. Artefacts visible
2. Values (intermediate level of consciousness), and
3. Underlying assumptions (invisible or unconscious).

You should use this vocabulary and these frameworks to:

- Understand what you will read about culture and cross-cultural negotiation and conflict resolutions and speak more sensitively about culture
- Be wary of stereotyping people from cultures different to your own - over emphasising the influence of culture on behaviours
- Be cautious not to generalise and attribute a person’s behaviour solely to their cultural background
- Look beyond culture at the individual differences – personality, profession, intelligence, even EQ, and

## 5.1 Cultural rules: Communication barriers

- Adapting a negotiation style starts with showing consideration for the other side's cultural norms and constraints.
- For instance, group consensus is important to people from collectivist cultures. We consider the impact of their individual decisions on other group members and relationships. You may find such a negotiator consulting with others before making key decisions, because the collective spirit of an agreement is important.
    - Conversely, precision and detail are prioritized in individualistic cultures who assume that negotiators are at the table and are delegated with the power to act. They would view such efforts to ensure all parties are happy as wasted time.
    - The cautious and inclusive actions of the collectivist negotiator may look like stonewalling, being unyielding, or unwilling to compromise. The problem of impatience, not respecting the other side's view of time, is compounded when negotiators adopt an inflexible attitude, an unwillingness to adapt to different negotiation conventions, time frames, or ways of making decisions.
- Misinterpreting behavior. Monochronic cultures - are used to following more logical and sequential steps in the decision making or problem solving process. Polychronic cultures - nonlinear approaches to problem solving. Circular processes may reflect different thinking styles, indicate a cautious attitude, or an aversion to risk. Alternatively, delays can be tactical, applying pressure to reduce time to force concessions or used to test their counterparts commitment.
- Loss of face. Loss of face is thought to originate in China, yet it's observed in other Asian and Arabic countries. To lose face essentially means to be humiliated or embarrassed in front of important others, either as a group or as an individual.
    - Broadly speaking, no one likes to be embarrassed or diminished in the eyes of others, so it should be considered something of a universal rule in negotiation. When you're negotiating, face is given to one's counterpart by gestures of respect or of deference and consideration for your counterparts reputation or image.
    - For example, showing respect by ensuring that the seniority of the negotiators at the table is matched. Other actions to help others save face can include structuring a deal a certain way, so an image is maintained, for example, that credit is given openly to a partner with a seat on a board.
    - Saying things that might be difficult or high risk privately, and choosing your words or phrases very selectively, and possibly even using excuses to prevent having to admit a failure. To adapt your negotiating style to address these three common issues, I recommend you keep in mind three key points.
    - First, refrain from over-emphasizing culture as the only source of behavior. Secondly, consider the context that is the substance of the deal and the idiosyncrasies of your counterparts, their personality for example. And thirdly, be patient with the efforts of others as they try to adjust their style. They may not get it right first time. Finally, be mindful of counterparts who seek to use the culture card to gain advantage. Remember, culture is an important driver of human behavior, but it can also be over-emphasized. And at times can even be used as an excuse.

## 5.2 How culture manifests in negotiation

- 3D negotiation - Cultural values in negotiation manifest in the form of what they call different expectations in and around negotiation.
    - **These expectations framework provides a useful overview, not only of how different cultures view the process, their surface expectations, but also how they're likely to approach key elements, their deeper expectations of the negotiation process.**
- LAX & SEBENIUS' model highlights four surface and process expectations: Formality, Etiquette, Communication styles, and Emotional expression.
    - **Formality** concerns how negotiators expect to be addressed whether by their title or their first name, to be dressed, and have meetings conducted.
    - **Etiquette** refers to things such as, how introductions are made, how business cards are exchanged, and whether socializing is expected as part of the negotiation process, and whether it takes place before or after the deal is done.
    - **Communication styles** indicate whether the negotiation is interactive, or people speak in long monologues and expect not to be interrupted.
    - **Emotional expressions** signals whether negotiators are expected to keep a straight face, or whether they're allowed to show strongly felt or negative emotions.
- The deeper expectations that LAX & SEBENIUS describe are those that go to the fundamental heart of a negotiation.
    - Is this negotiation for example, just one step in a broader strategy to advance the relationship between the parties, or is the process seen by a counterparty purely in transactional terms?
- From there we ask who should be involved, or who should be represented, in a certain negotiation?
- How does each party perceive that the agreement should be implemented after the negotiation concludes?
    - A deal is a deal.
    - While other cultures are likely to view a negotiated agreement as something akin to a road map and may expect to be able to change, or re-interpret a clause or an agreement as the relationship evolves and the context changes.
- Erin Meyer the author of one of our key readings for this week, recommends five key actions to help reduce miscommunication in cross-cultural situations, and they are:
    - Figure out how to express disagreement. How do you say no in the culture?
    - Recognize what emotional expressiveness signifies.
    - Learn how the other culture builds trust.
    - Avoid yes or no questions
    - Be aware of what you put in writing.
- Self-awareness and Fells notes this, that negotiators need to be aware that doing what comes naturally, such as getting straight down to business as soon as the meeting starts, may be viewed negatively by others as an attempt to control proceedings or gain an advantage.

## Hofstede: A critique

- Criticisms:
    - Using national culture rather than ethnic culture as the unit of analysis
    - Limits when it comes to multicultural nations
    - Absence of indigenous representation
    - Based on a sample from one (1) company – IBM
    - Data collected nearly 50 years ago
    - Dramatic historical change since then (e.g. fall of the iron curtain in the 80s)

## 5.3: When context matters

- Edward and Mildred Hall proposed four dimensions to demonstrate differences based on Communication form.
    - Starting with number one high versus low context communication. **Directness or indirectness of communication.** We are quite subtle forms of communication are used. For example, when you read others to derive true meaning in interpersonal exchange. High context cultures use indirect forms of communication. The receiver expected to decode the message and its meaning based on the context. In Japan and France for example, where and how things are said adds to or alters the meaning of what is being said. Meaning needs to be decoded by the listener. In contrast, participants in low context cultures such as Germany or the United States communicate important information directly and in a way that is to the point, limiting the scope for implied meaning. There is little risk of misunderstanding when you communicating with in the same context. However, when we move across context, that's when you need to apply your reading of the situation more closely. Consider this, a German negotiator, expecting and demanding clarity quizzes their Japanese counterpart very directly about what they mean. When it comes to an agreement that will want to o know by whom, by when, how, or how many, who where, why, and if not, why not? How do you think the Japanese negotiator would find this style? Being comfortable with vagueness an indirectness, they would feel very unfamiliar and uncomfortable as though they were being interrogated. When you're capable of making these observations, picking up on these cues, you can act on it in two ways. One, you can attach an additional layer of meaning to behaviors that help you to navigate your interactions. Two, you can adjust your own behavior. Have a positive impact on the quality of communication and relationships, increasing the likelihood of making wise agreements and forging constructive, mutually beneficial relationships.
    - Edward Hall's next to mention was number two, spatial orientation. The distance between participants that may have an influence on negotiation.
    - Number three, monochrome versus polychrome conception of time. Monochrome cultures are process oriented, which means one thing is done after another in a linear sense. In polychrome cultures, multiple actions can can occur simultaneously.
    - And finally number four, information speed. Information speed refers to the ease and speed when it's information flows within a group.
- In Hall and Hall's categorization of cultures, the context of the communication is said to add additional meaning to the words that are said. Of course, the interplay between the situation, the individual person's attributes, personality traits.
    - For example, their individual motivations, the context and their culture make attribution an interpretation of behavior quite difficult at times.
    - Some of the attitudes and behaviors listed under one dimension could easily appear under more than one dimension or be mutually reinforcing.
        - So some examples the masculine characteristic of a results orientated competitive wind for example might also be typical characteristic of individualism. High individualism tends to also be associated with low power difference. Similarly high uncertainty avoidance is linked to a high power difference.
    - Those from high uncertainty avoidance, high power difference or high context cultures also seem more disposed to trust. So understanding culture is clearly more complex than simply noting one feature of a culture. The whole profile should be considered in seeking to understand how people from two different cultures may interact. Or how I manage are of a certain culture will perform if relocated to a certain country to manage local stuff.
    
    # Week 6: Coping with complexity: From multi-party negotiation to conflict transformation
    
    ## 6.1: Complexity in negotiation and conflict resolution
    
    - Complexity in negotiation and conflict resolution stems from a number of factors, including
        - the number of parties directly involved and, or the number of stakeholders affected by, but not directly involved in discussions.
        - The history of the issue or issues.
        - The number of intersecting issues bringing with them inter-dependencies that can be hard to unravel, making it difficult to create momentum.
        - The investment of the parties in achieving certain outcomes.
        - The role of representative negotiation, often referred to as the agent constituent problem, and culture clashes that happened when negotiators come from different cultures with different conventions.
        - Watkins mounts a convincing critique of mainstream negotiation theories and frameworks. He says that conventional models of negotiation can be superficial and rely too much on an imagined world where there are limited number of parties, and a well-defined set of issues. Watkins says such models don't factor in the emotional dynamics of a negotiation. The lightened sources of conflict or the challenges of group dynamics, such as divided loyalties within a team. Ambiguity and uncertainty, make it more difficult for you to evaluate your counterpart's true interests, to accurately value traits, and evaluate options relative to those interests.
        - The sequence of a negotiation is an important consideration when it comes to managing complexity. Particularly with multiple stage negotiations, or when several negotiations are embedded, within the one large negotiation.
        - Sequencing - chunk to create smaller, more manageable negotiations and build a series of small agreements. Together, these chunks achieve the final outcome. Imagine you're making a large sale to an important customer.
        - You need to be more strategic in the order of your negotiations. Your sequence would start with seeking approval for the concession from your boss.
            - Despite its appeal, sequencing does run a certain amount of risk. It might be seen as lobbying or doing deals behind others backs, rather than bringing everyone together to transparently discuss an issue, with all the cards on the table.
        - In their book, 3D Negotiation, the authors, Lax and Sebenius, describe what they call three dimensions in a negotiation that comprise the necessary and sufficient conditions for success.
            - The first dimension describes the skill of the negotiator.
            - The second dimension, describes the creative options that are developed by the negotiators. It's about the creative thinking, the thoughtful restructuring, or the crafting of options that you need so that you can find agreements that make complex needs, and interests. For Lax and Sebenius, these two dimensions are both important, necessary conditions for negotiators to secure agreement in less complex negotiations.
            - The third dimension, concerns the actions you take to shape the operating environment. What you do away from the table. Dimension three actions are taken to change some of the fundamental stumbling blocks to agreement.
    - When overwhelmed by complexity, human seek simplicity. Coalitions offer one way to simplify multiparty dynamics by reducing the number of parties. Instead of there being six different groups all represented around the table, they can be just to larger groups whose interests are aligned. Coalition building might appear to be a value free exercise, but it can also present further obstacles in the negotiation dynamic.

## 6.2: Multiparty stakeholders

- Imagine small trade unions negotiating as a coalition in a wage negotiation with a large and powerful employer. Or small countries negotiating as a coalition with a larger and more militarily or economically powerful country. These coalitions form around a unified position and they often come as a response to a perceived power difference. When formed in these situations, coalitions may force some parties to dilute or set aside some of their interests. They may even marginalize or disenfranchise some parties. These coalitions can also be unstable, promote adversarial bargaining, or use power plays to gain leverage or establish voting blocks.
- When parties delegate very right to negotiate to a third party, there are two risks that need to be monitored.
    - Conflicts of interest and misaligned incentives. Conflicts of interest, throughout a negotiation process, the individual interests of an agent might come into conflict with the interests of the group they represent. The ethical questions around the appropriateness of a potential representative should not be underestimated.
    - Misaligned incentives, misaligned incentives are problematic when representative negotiators are agents working commercially on behalf of a principle. The classic example is a real estate agent, a realtor working for a vendor to sell a property.
- There are three key recommendations for designing and managing the multiparty process.
    - The first recommendation is to use a secretariat. Establish a secretariat to manage the information flow, invitations to meetings, briefing papers, contracts, minutes, and the distribution of meeting papers. All this work can be a heavy burden, and one is best managed by a professional administrator.
    - The second recommendation is to use a facilitator. A facilitator or a third party consultant sometimes or experts can be highly recommended if not mandatory to ensure the constructive use of meeting times.
    - And the third recommendation is to upfront determine a deadlock method. It's really important for groups to consider as they forming how they intend to make decisions or resolve an impasse.
- Three obvious options exist, voting, consensus, or by unanimous decision. Each has strengths and weaknesses.
    - Majority voting, it will feel fair to many people, especially those raised in democracies who are used to majority rule decision making. Voting can, however, also lead to poor outcomes for minority members whose valuable input and opinion can be overridden. The knee jerk reaction to vote on it can lead to poor value creation when debate is prematurely curtailed in favor of an opportunistic vote.
    - The second is consensus. And consensus decision making involves the whole group publicly agreeing on a position. In some situations, consensus is used to disguise internal dissent among members of a group and give the group a public face of goodwill and teamwork. Some regional political groups, for example, use consensus as a means of displaying regional solidarity on issues. For example, ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The problem with consensus, however, is that in trying to get everyone agree to a public statement or a position on an issue. Means that the group inevitably moves slowly and conservatively, and consensus positions are inherently cautious, minimalist positions or decisions.
    - And the third is by unanimous decision. Unanimous decision making is a technique that is used to display a stronger decision or a firm position on an issue. It forces groups to tease out the interests of all group members. And while this takes a little more time, it means all issues, interests, and concerns are heard. For example, juries use unanimous decision making as their decision rule. And this is done to force the centers to voice their concerns and to debate the issues with those who hold alternative views. The logic it seems is that in cases where such important decisions rest on the shoulders of a group of people, they should all agree on the verdict that they reach.
    
    ## 6.3: Change the game: Conflict transformation
    
- What do we mean when we say a conflict is intractable? And intractable conflict is one that seems impervious to all attempts at resolution. These conflicts tend to have a long history, high complexity, an extremely destructive effects, including armed warfare, civil unrest, or other forms of violence.
- We use the term intractable conflict to describe sectarian identity or inter-ethnic conflicts. For example, the longest running UN peacekeeping mission in history on the island of Cyprus between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots is a classic example of an intractable conflict. Intractable conflict can also be used to denote civil war or situations of civil unrest.
- In recent times there are some examples of violent interethnic conflicts that have managed to ease and move towards resolution.
    - There's now relative peace in Rwanda following the genocide of the 1990s committed by the dominant Hutu tribe against the Tutsis and the moderate Hutus.
    - Northern Island is experienced some stability following the peace accords in the late 1990s. Apartheid has ended in South Africa.
    - The Sri Lankan Civil War has largely ended.
    - To some degree the same can be observed in Colombia.
- Against this backdrop, a term is emerged that is gained some currency within the broader field of conflict resolution, and that term is conflict transformation.
    - The word transformation is favored by some writers and practitioners over the word resolution. An interesting departure from the traditional language. Mitchell argues, this term is now being used as a reaction to the over use, and indeed, the misuse of the term conflict resolution. Resolution he claims is often misused to describe situations of conflict management, negotiation, or settlement. In fact, the term resolution is meant to describe a situation reserved for conflicts. It's meant to describe a state where there is lasting change in the parties previously conflict-plagued relationship.
    - Transformation is widely debated, but there are two common threads emphasized by Mitchell that draw some consensus. The emphasis on the post agreement stage, ie, the steps to be implemented to cement the process of conflict resolution. And the need to consciously and actively address the structural sources of conflict to prevent its recurrence. So for example, to consciously and actively put measures in place to transform the conflictual relationships.
- Examples of conflict transformation would then include addressing the causes of poverty that lead to crime or civil unrest. Looking at access to water or land ownership when conflict occurs among displaced people. Looking at, establishing or restoring a sense of Justice to people who have been disenfranchised.
- Conflict transformation as an idea forces us to consider the implementation of reform measures that identify and aim to eliminate the original sources of the conflict. What are the issues that exacerbate or trigger the violent expression of conflict? In ethnic or identity conflict situations, such triggers can be around how beliefs or values are expressed or even suppressed. Sometimes transformational efforts are aimed at finding ways for beliefs to be expressed which do not impose on the values or beliefs of others. Outside the realm of such extreme situations, there are perhaps lessons for the modern manager to take away from the efforts of pacemakers to stop bloodshed and violence. When conflict arises, you must look beyond the interpersonal or intergroup rivalries, perhaps between department or even between your company and a community. And ask, were there structural reasons for the conflict we've just been through? Are there ways we can address these structural issues or resource shortages that cause the conflict and could cause it to arise again?
- Antipathies, rivalries and resentments do, of course, linger after an agreement in conflict resolution situations. So often it is important to evaluate if there can be changes that can be made to systems structures, perhaps even workplace cultures to prevent future flare ups.
    - Reframing is a potentially useful technique here were a different explanation for the conflict a new narrative, so to speak, can be found. You move from describing an ethnic or identity conflict, or a values conflict, or a clash of ideologies towards describing a resource conflict. Such a neutral term helps the parties look back on the conflict in different ways to look more positively towards living with their former enemies in a conflict free future. This is vitally important work in the international environment, but also in domestic situations.
- Such conflict is unlikely to disappear from the world and so it's important we have the skills and insights to try and address the causes of such conflict. And find ways through the complexity, so peaceful and lasting solutions can be found.

## [A Harvard negotiations expert explains why Trump failed to get a heath-care deal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2017/03/27/a-harvard-negotiations-expert-explains-why-trump-failed-to-get-a-heath-care-deal/?noredirect=on)

Unlike when you’re doing a real estate deal or a deal where you’re going to be putting your name on a product that already exists, when you’re doing a complex deal with lots of parties, lots of interests, lots of constraints, you really need to map out exactly how you’re going to get from day one to day 50 or 100. It seems that President Trump’s approach in this case was very much day-to-day, hour-to-hour. That rarely goes right.

You can get lucky. But if you’re not taking into account how things are going to play out for the many parities who have very different interests and perspectives than you do, you’re probably going to make some mistakes along the way. As an example, it was never clear whether Trump was really for or sort of for it, and it changed over time. It wasn’t clear if he was in charge of selling it or other people were in charge of selling it. He hedged on whether he wanted his [name associated](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-branding-obamacare-repeal-235831) with it. There’s so many parts where you see that there was no grand strategy. There were a bunch of tactical moves that were loosely tied together.

You cannot walk in there dictating terms. You can’t walk in there with ultimatums. You can’t walk in there pretending that you know and they don’t know. Instead, what you need to do is work with these people and figure out a way to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of all of you and that one deal.

**My life revolves around beating instincts out of people. That doesn’t mean they’re always wrong. It’s just that when the stakes are high, instincts need to be audited. Here’s the thing: Instincts are useful and practical if you’re doing the same deal over and over again. If this is the hundredth time you’re doing a land deal of this kind, your instincts pretty much capture everything you need to think about. But if you find yourself in a new environment, a kind of deal you haven’t done before — or you’re doing legislation as opposed to transactions, as in this case — your instincts are the last thing you should be relying on.**

There was the [statement](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/27/politics/trump-health-care-complicated/) about “nobody knew health care could be so complicated.” Then in [remarks](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000005008006/trump-health-bill-vote.html) after repeal and replace failed, he talked about how [he learned a lot](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000005008006/trump-health-bill-vote.html) about the procedures, the arcane processes or something like that. To me, that’s kind of sad, to use a Trumpian word. You shouldn’t have to learn these things as a result. These are the kinds of things you should be gearing up for with complete focus and energy.
